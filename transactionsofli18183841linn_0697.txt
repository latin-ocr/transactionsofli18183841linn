The 111agnificent iuscct just described is named in honour of william Sharp
MacLeay‚ Esq.‚ author of Ηωνω Entonzolugz'coe3 and I have much pleasnre in
dedicating it to one who has so ably treated of the geography, manners and
natural affinitics of the insects which compose the Linnean genus Scaraboeus.

Eucammoaz, mihi.

The above family, according to my views, consists of the following gc-

 

 

ΠθΓὶὶ :—
Genus. i* Country. ¹ Typical Species.
1
l. Euchcirus, Kirby . . . . East Indics . . i longimanus, Fabricius.
2. Protomacrus, Newnmm . . Smyrna? . . , ¹ bimucronatus, Pallas.
3. Cheirotonus, Hope. . . . Assam . . . MacLeaii, Ilope.

 

The above three genera are all that are known at present3 they are inha-
bitants of the Old world, and 1 do not know any from the New world corre-
sponding with them, although an anonymous author, who has published an
account of Venezuela, asscrts that the longimanus of Fabricius is found in
the last-mentioned locality3 but fron] thc description of the species, which is
concisely given by the author, it is evident some other insect than longi-
manus, Fal). is alluded to, and I think it not improbable, therefore, thar
one of the Goqua or Sawyer Bectles‚ which abound in Venezuela‚ has been
mistaken for the Fabrician insect. ΤΟ the first of the above-mentioned genera
the name of *Mam-opus has been attributed, but as that term was previously
used in other branches of zoology, and is still applied to the Kanguroo Beetle
described by Dr. Shaw, Mr. Kirby has very properly substitutcd the name of
Euclzeirus.
