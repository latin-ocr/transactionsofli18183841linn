opereular outlet; because the larva of the tailless Batraehian presents at one
period of its existence a similar structure; yet if that state were persistent
instead of transitory, it would still be a Reptile and not a Fish. It cannot
therefore be determined by the inodifications of the respiratory organs
whether the Lepi(l‹›s1·1·e›2 be a Fish or a Reptile. (fan it 110 proved to be a
Fish hy the modifications of its digestive system Ρ A straight intestine with
au internal spiral valve has hitherto been met with only in the class of Fishes ;
yet it occurs rather as an exceptional than a general structure in that class.
Supposing that a spiral intestinal valve had been discovered in the Amphizmm,
Siren, or Proteus, should we have been justified on that ground in removing
such species to the class of Fishes? There is good evidence that the intestine
of the Icletlzyvsamus was provided with a spii-al valve, yet it is not on that ac-
count regarded as a Fish. IfI inistake not, indeed, the intestinal spiral valve
of higher Cli‹uzslropletysgii is a structure dependent on a slight modification
only of that pceuliar disposition of the intestinal eanal which characterizes
the gill-breathing· larvze ofthe Bali-achia: we have hut to inclose the series of
spiral coils of gut of the tadpole in a common investing membrane, so as to
conceal the coinplication under a simple exteriore and little more is wanting
to render the conversion of the one 11110 1110 other structure complete.

In reviewing the peculiarities of the 05500115 system with reference to 1110
affinities of the Lepidosiren, it may first be remarked, that 110 Amphiliian has
hitherto presented an unossified condition of the bodies of its vertebrte, cr of
the parts of the skull containing the organ of hearing. VVould such osteolo-
logical modifications, it may be asked, have sufficed to alter our opinion of the
classific relations of the Siren? Such a condition of the 5110101011, 11 may he
answered, is by 110 means characteristic of the class of Fishes. If any general
ichthyic character can be taken from the skeleton, it is the reeiprocal 11111011
of the bodies of the vertebrae by opposite concave facets. Now the Perenni-
branchiate Rati-achia do in fact present this very structure; yet they have
not, any more than the Iclztlzgsosctzciff, been transferred to the class of Fishes
on that account ι we may conclude, thereforeq that their position in zoological
classifications would not have been changed, even if their skeleton had resem-
bled that of the Lepidosiren. It is only 111 a few fishes that the bones are
green; neither in the scaly nor naked reptiles has the skeleton been found to
