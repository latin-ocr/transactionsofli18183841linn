inasmuch as a naine without any meaning must be less objectionable than
onc with a false meaning. Hoppe in 1799, according to Gaudin, gave to it
the name of Stat-mia, and Srnith in English Botany‚ in 1803, that of Knappiu.
The proper naine would, therefore, undoubtedly be δέω-Μία, if this had not
been already given by Gaertner to a species of Guettarda, of which, whether
it really deserve to constitute a genus or not Ι cannot tell. In this uncertainty
I leave it sor the present under the naine by which it is best known to English
botanists; at the sanie time, I cannot but think that Sir J. E. Sinith acted not
wisely in altering the specific naine. flliuinm merely i1nplies that it is a very
sinall Grass, and by no means necessarily that it is the smallest of the. genus ;
and agrosticlea is quite as objectionable, as it would be easy to conceive a
Grass much more like an Agrestis without losing the generic distinction of
Knappl'a.

STIPACEAE.

Spiculae in an equal panicle, one-flowered, without any rudiment either
above or below. Gluines herbaceous at the base, scariose at the margin, in-
cluding the floret. The principal character is in the outer palea, which is
convolute, and hardens on the seed without being attached to it. The extre-
1nity thus rolled up forins the base of an awn, which is connected by a inore
or less evident joining* at the base, and is in most instances geniculate and
twisted. This character alone seems in all cases to carry the habit along
with it, and to fix the plant among the Stamene. Squamulae 3.

1. Piptatlzernm. Floret sessile. Paleae subcoriaceous. Awn straight, ‹leci—
duous. Panicle lax.

2. Stipa. Floret stalkcd. Paleae eoriaceous, the inner entire. Awn with an
evident joining into the paleae, genic-alate and twisted. (In S. aristelln
the floret is sessile, and the awn straight and even).

3. Aclmatlzerum. Gluines scariose‚ herbaceous at the base. Floret stalked,
enveloped in silky hairs. Paleae membranous. Awn geniculate and
twisted, the joining obscurely marked.

* I use joint for the thing joined; johziny, for the point of union, The arm is a joint2 the clbow a
joining. This language appears to me more correct, and more convenient in botanical descriptions‚ than
the usual confusion between the two terms.
