Mr. ΒΑΜ-111 οη tlze Ergot of [ἕψε. 481

though since that time some ergotized 11101115 001110 occasionally into my hands,
Ι never examined them with an intention to discover anything new 111 1110111,
1111 111 October 1838, when Mr. John Smith, the chief assistant 111 1110 Royal
Botanic Grai-den at Kew, brought to 1110 501110 specimens of ergotizcd plants of
a species of Elymus, which were not only infected with ergot, but of which
every external part was infectcd with a minute filamentous fungus, bearing 011
1111111110 number of sporidia, which I never before had observed.

Mr. Smith has given a very detailcd and correct account of this fungus, in
a paper which was read before the Linuean Society 011 the 6111 of November,
1838. He also communicated his discovery soon after he showed it to 1110 to
his friend Mr. Quekett, who read 011 the 4111 of December before the Linnean
Society a long 01111 very elaborate paper 011 1110 501110 subject, and 111 which he
quotes some very interesting works by M. Leveille, Dr. Phoebus, and Philippar,
which, to judge from Mr. Quekett's quotations and copies of figures, seem to
110 very correct observations and illustrations of that subject3 but these ori-
ginal 1101115 Ι 11ον0 1101 yet 50011, 01111 from all these observations and illustra-
110115 Ι 0111 1101 yet convinced that these filamentous fungi with numerous spo-
ridia are the cause or the consequence of the elgot, because,

lst, Every gramineous plant 15 equally infectcd with that minute filainentous
fungus, yet very few of these plants produce ergots ς 01111 amongst agricultural
grains, the rye is the only 0110 11101 15 subject to that disease; among the many
hundred ears of wheat that I examined in every stage of its growth, I found
only one spikelet that produced three ergots, 01111 0110 spikelet with only one
ergot.

Because, 2nd, 111 autumn all decayiug plants are infected with such filamen-
tous fungi and minute sporidia; and Mr. Smith, when he brought to me the first
specimen of his ergot, brought 1110 0150 0 specimen of a flower of Canna indica,
in which not only the inside of the 01111101· was infected with this filamentons
fungus, but also the individual pollen grains were strongly infected with it.

For these reasons, I cannot yet consider the question, of the cause of the
Ergot, as finally and satisfactorily settled3 but I hope those 1101111011515 who
have already done 50 11111011 011 11101 subject will persevere 111 their researches
and experiments till they finally succeed.
