XXXV. On some new Bratilian Plants allied lo the Λάΐιυά] order

Burmanniacete. By JOHN ans, Esq.³ F.L.S.
Head March 3rd and 17th, 1840.

Ι VENTURE to present to the notice of the Linnean Society the following
ohservations on some new and interesting· plants found hy me in Brazil, and
hearing a close affinity to But-numum. They appear to constitute the types
of new genera3 and though at first sight they would seem to belong· to
But-manniacew, I think it will be admitted that the differences they present
entitle thern to be considered as forming, if not a new natural order, at least a
very distinct suhfamily. We are already indehted to the learned Dr. Von Mar„
tius for a knowledge of several But-nzmmins indigenous to Brazil. In his Nora
Gener« ct Species Pltmtarum Brasiliensium not only are thc characters of the
genus Burmmmia ably detailed‚ but five Brazilian species, which he met with
in the interior provinces, are there fully described. The same genus has also
been met with in North America, two species having been found to which the
name of Tripterella was given by Michanx. Seven other species have likewise
been found in Africa, India, and New IIolland. These are all the plante.¹ as
far as Ι ean leam, that cor-respond with the character hitherto given of Bm·-
manniacew. The North American plant described by Mr. Nuttall under the
name of Apteria setacea, as well as two new species discovered by Dr. Blume
in Java and called by him Gongfl‘mthcs camlizlu and (igsmnosiplzon aplnsllum.
will be hereafter mentioued.

I have had no opportunity of examining any speeies of But-mannia, except
Β. bicolor, Mart.‚ which was first discovered in 1818 hy Dr. Von Martius in the
province of Minas Ger-aes. Mr. Gardner also found the same species in 1837 in
his ascent to the higher portions of the Organ Mountain-range in the province
of Rio de Janeir03 and to him I am indebted for a specimen which has
enabled me to comprehend more correctly the relation which my plants bear
