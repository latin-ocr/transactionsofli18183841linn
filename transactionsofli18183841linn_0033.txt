vations on Glyceran, seems disposed to place some reliance on the simple 01·
branched filainents which compose the stigma; but from Kunth's work, as
well as from what little Ι have been able to examine mysels‚ I should doubt if
this could be trusted as a gener-ic distinction.

The seed in some cases is entirely ‹letsacliccl and of itself falls out of the
paleae; in others it is inclosed by, and falls off with them, but without ad—
hering to either; sometimes it is attached to the upper, and sometimes to both
paleae. It is sometimes furrowed, and sometimes has an even surface3 is
sometimes crested‚ and sometimes hairless3 sometimes linear and thin, some-
times thick and turgid. All these particulars are useful in the formationes
genera, yet perhaps hardly any so constant as to prove at once a difference of
genus.

The tribes Ι propose are the following:

l. ANDROPOGONEAE. 8. ARUNDINACEAE.
2. Pinnem. 9. CHLORIDEAE.

3. ORYZEAE. lO. AVENACEAE.

4. PHALAmDEAE. ᾖ ll. FESTUCACEAE.

5. PHLEINEAE. 12. HORDEACEAE.

(5. AuRostEAE. 13. PAPPOPHOREAE.
7. STIPACEAE. 14. ROTTBOELLIACEAE.

In discriminating these tribes, and the genera which they comam, 1 have
endeavoured to gire such characters as will apply to the plants of Europe.
My knowledge is too imperfect to enable me to hope to seize correctly the
distinguishing marks of those of more distant regions. there a character
occurs only in one genus of a tribe, or in one tribe among the Gmsses, I mark it
with a note of admiration: this plan rendcrs it unnecessary to mention under
the other tribes or other genera that such a particular is wanting.

ANDROPOGONEAE.

The proper characters of this tribe seem to be, that the spiculae are in pairs,
one sessile and one stalked, or, at the extremity of each branch‚ in threes, of
which two are stalked. The sessile spiculae are always perfect, containing
one perfect floret and the palea-like rudiment of another. The stalked spiculae
