128 Mr. OolLssY on certain Australian Quadrupeds,

1nunicating the intelligence of any strange or uncommon event to distant tribes
hy raising dense columns of smoke in different directions over the face of the
country, and we fancied that these were their rude telegraphs, kept ready for
immediate usc when an occasion occurred to require it. A more minute exa-
mination, however, soon convinced us of our error3 we found, in fact, that
the materials were not thrown promiscuously together, as would naturally
have hcen the case had they been collected by the nativos for the purpose of
burning, but that each stick and fragment was so Curiously intertwined and
woven with the rest, that the whole formed a solid eompact mass, so firmly
bound together, that it was absolutely impossible to remove a part without at
the same time moving the whole fabric. Our kangaroo dogs also drew our
attention more particularly to the examination of these curious structures, by
the constant ardour which they displayed in barking and scratehing when-
ever we fell in with them, thus manifestly intimating that they expected to
tind something inside. At length we broke several of them open, a work of
no small difficulty from the solidity of their structure, and were not a little
surprised to find in the interior a small nest occupied hy an animal something
between a rabbit and a rat, which had construeted this formidable and mas-
sive stronghold to protect itself against the attacks of the native dog. For
this purpose the little animal chooses some small bush or shrub, as a fixed
point d'appui to commcnce its operations; and by gradually working round
this, and interlacing the materials of its foi-taliee, first of all with the growing
hranehes of the centre bush, and afterwards with one another, gradually ex-
tends it to the cnormous dimensions already specificd, and enjoys the reward
ot' its perseverane-e and ingenuity in suhsequcnt security and repose. This
little animal has ears exactly resembling those of a small rabbit, solt, downy
wool, and short hind legs, and, but for the tail, might readily pass for a small
rabbit.”

‚Something of this constructive faculty is observcd among the *S'quirrels and
Tamias, hut in neither of these genera is it developed so perfectly as in the
Camilia-us. Mr. Say, indeed, relates that the Tamia quadi-[rislam makes a
nest of the ‘⁶ hnrrs omeitltitmz, portions of the upright (uetus, small branchcs
of pine trees, and other vegetable productions, sufficient in some instances to
fill a eart,'' hut these do not appear to be artifieially woven together, as in the
