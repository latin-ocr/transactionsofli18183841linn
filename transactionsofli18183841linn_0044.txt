of the midribs, and gives to the spicula of this genus, as Ι understand it, an
appearance very different from that whieh we find iu AeHNouoN. Gaudin
and Kunth deserihe a subulate rudiment to several speeies, hut exeept in

Amrfflfmuis. In some speeies of this genus the glumes are united at the
base, and in some the inner edges ol* the single palea are united so as to form
a tubular ean-olla, but neither of these characters runs through the genus.
CRYPSIS is plaeed by Kunth among the Phalaridew, and its dense paniele has
obliged me to plave it here, but¹ its eoinparatively large and firm paleae might
perhaps= vindieate sor it a station among the Agrum-tidem. These tribes, how-
ever, are So elosely allied that Ι have more than onee doubted the propriety of
keeping them ¹<epa1·ate. The thin paleae and dense spilx'e unite in iudueing me
to transfer GASTRIDH'M from the Agr-ostialmn to this tribe. Palisot de Beauvois,
indeed, ascribes to this genus eoriaeeous paleam and ‚Sir J. E. ›Smith by his
remarks on Milium, with whieh he unites it, seems to hold the same opinion.
Ι find, however, the palea· of both speeies to be as described by Kunth ⁴⁴ te-
nuiter membranaeetej' and that in all stages.

Some speeies of P‘)(‘ll¹‘²g“'‘1 might seem to belong to this tribe, but we cannot,
divide the genus. The canaparatively* strong genienlate and twisted dorsa]
awn of Logia-us, with the two lengthened points of the outer palea, ‚show it

to belong to the „iwan-ew.

This tribe is rather formed to eontain all the ¹single-llowered (ii-asses which
will not enter into any of the other tribes, than as uniting plant*= having a
very distinct character ol' their own. They are all small platus, with a paniele
of fine and almost capillary branehes, and small flowers and seeds. The
glumes are too large in proportion to sull'er the student to search for the
