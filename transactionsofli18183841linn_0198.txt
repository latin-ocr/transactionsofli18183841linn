minosoe. Linnaeus placed it next to Cicer, J ussieu between Ononis and Antlzgsllis.
De Candolle in classing the Legmninosw strictly according to the embryo and
the germination, as far as known, places Aracleisaino11gst his Geoffi·‹)yce, or
Papilionacew with combined stamina and a straight cmb1·yo; at the same
time, well aware of the little real affinity between Arachis and the arbores-
cent Gfflgffi'vjlw‚ 116 suggests the probability of its forming with l'oandzeia a
small distinct tribe. l'uamlzeia has, however, since been discovered, both by
Ernest Meyer 111111 by Decaisne, to have a curved embryO, and has been
removed to Phaseolew, and Araclzis remains alone amongst genera with
which it is connected by the single character derived from the embryo.

The very obvious resemblance of the flowers with those of Stgslosantltes
first led me to suppose that it might be better placed amongst Ilesfissareoe,
where the peculias foliage of Arachis is not uncommon; and a closer ex-
amination of the structure of the organs of fructification in both genera has
furnished some remarkable pcculiarities which seem still further to connect
them.

The perfect flowers of machis, accurately described by De Candolle 115 to
the caIyX, corolla, stamina, ovarium and style, have appeared to me to be
constantly sterile3 they have, indeed, a perfect ovarium with two or three
ovules‚ but I have always observed it to fall off with the calyx, and the
legumes, as far as I have been able to ascertain from dried specimens of
several 51166165 111 various states, 111156 constantly from female flowers of a
very different structure. These have neither calyx, corolla, nor stamina, but
from between two bracteolae, similar 10 those which are found at the base of
the sterile flowers, proceeds a stiff rigid stipes or torus, which is speedily
reflexed and elongated, and 15 terminated by what appears 10 the naked eye
a sharp point. Examined under a glass this point discloses at its extremity
a truncated‚ somewhat concave aud dilated stigma ; and within it will be found
a cell, within which are lodged two or threc ovoid, anatropous ovules placed
transversely 0116 above the other. After fecundation, when the extremity has
nearly reached the ground, it begins to swell, but remains continuous with
the 5111165 or torus, without any articulation even at the maturity, when the
legume is usually broken off with more or less of laceration.

The perfect flowers in *S'tylosantlzes are precisely similar to those of Arachis',
