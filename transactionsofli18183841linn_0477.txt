ing· membrano& with numerous minute p01·es; and frequently with larger
orifices or oscules, which are more sparingly and irregularly dispersed over
their surfaces ; with passages 01· canals communicating through the poros and
oscules one with another, along which the water finds a ready course or cir-
culation‚ and affords nutriment to all the inner parts of the 111asses; with
locomotive spornles; and in some species with fixed sporidia.

Concerning these last-mentioned bodies, which I have previously supposed
to be sporidia, a fuller notice is here requisito.

Although M. De Laniarck³s has said of the gelatinous bodies or grains that
are so numerous in the Spongilloe, “que rien de semblable n'a encore ete
observe dans les veritables Eponges,'' yet they have been recently detected in
the Spongioe stlat-imm for Professor Link has expressly made known in his
essay in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Seiences at Berlin, that
M. Ehrenberg told him, that he had seen them (Sporangienss) in very many
Sponges of the Red Sea. His own words are as follow: “Auch sagt mir
Herr Ehrenberg, (lass er an inehreren Spongien im Rothen Meere Sporangien
bemerkt habegx?

And indeed these seedlike bodies, little spheres, spherules, or sferette, spo-
rangien or sporidia, may be seen well represented in fig. C. at t. c. t. c.‚ and in
fig. E. at a. α. (1., of Donati'sll Plate VIII„ given to illustrate the marine pro-
duction called by him “ Alcionio primo di Dioscoride‚'' which is synonymous
with the Alqzsoniwn cydoniumffl of Li11111e115**‚ and sl. cotoneum of Pallas††;

ss As this membrane is subject to some variation, it may be used for a character to distinguish the
genera of the Sponyiae sslarinae. † Anim. sans Vert., tom. ii. p. 99, edit. 1816.

ἶ It is worth while to note, that Link uses in this passage the same word as he had just before
done (at p. 120.) when he was describing the similar seedlike bodies (Sporangien) of the Sponqilla; no
uncertainty can consequently arise about the exactly identical nature of these bodies.

Ἥ The Alcyonium cydoniam of Muller, which is the Cydoniam Mulleri os Fleming and Johnston, is
a very different substance, being a true Polypary. Yet Ehrenberg deems the A. cydoniam of Miiller
to be only a young specimen of Alcyoniam (Iiyitatum of Linnaeus; and from the figures 3 and 4 in
tab. 81. vol. iii. of the Zoologia Danica, edit. Abildgaard (Havn. 1789), it certainly much resembles
the early form of that Zoophyte‚ and before it has developed itself into the usual fingerlike lobes.
