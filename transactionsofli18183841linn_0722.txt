oval, very (lark hrown, convcx und hairy externally, coucave within,
comprising the palpal orgum, which are highly ‹levelope‹l‚ little compli-
cated in structure, projecting upwards to the articulatiou ot' the third
and fourth joints, and are of a dark hrowu colour.

Salticus distinctus is common iu Denhighshire on stone walls, iu the inter-
stices of which the female §pins a cell of compact white sill< attached to the
sui-face of the stoucs. In'the mouth of July she constructs in this cell a len-
ticular cocoon measuring {ab of an ineh in diameter, in which she ‹leposits
about lo spherical, pale yellow eggsg not agglutinated together„ The young⁴¹
even before they quit the cocoon, exhihit some of the marks most character-
istic of the species.

A description of this spidcr was originally given in the Londou and Edin-
burgh Pliilosophical Magaziuc, vol'. iii. 1). 436-7, under the name of Clubiwm
natatilis. Afterwards I was induc-ed to remove it to the genus Drassus on
account of the curvatnre ot' its maxilla* (Rescarches in Zoology‚ p. 332). Sub-
sequent investigations, made with great care, have sei-ved to convince me that
it belongs to the ⁴-Igelem‘dw³ as it. possesses several characteristics in common
with the spiders of that family. The anterior partos the cephalo-thorax is
