THE anomalous nature of the indigenous quad rupeds of Australia, the almost
exclusive predominance of the Marsupial family in that singular country, and
its extreme poverty in the ordinary Monadelphine groups of Mannnals‚ is one
of the most curious and interesting facts in modern zoology. Setting aside
thc bats, which their physic-al structure renders in a great measure independent
of local boundaries, and the Scals and Cena-ea, which, from the very nature of
thc clement they inhabit, arc circumscribed in their geographical range by
nonc of those insuperablc restrictions which limit the distribution of ordinary
quadrupcds, I ain acquainted with only six or seven specics of terrestrial
Mammals, out of at least sixty already known to inhabit the continent of
Australia and its immediate dependencies, which (lo not belong to Marsupial
forms. This fact is in itself sufficiently singular-3 hut our surprise is still
further excitcd when we learn, that, of these six or seven exceptions, all the
truly indigenous species belong exclusivcly to the order Rodentia, and that the
numerous tribes of Quadrammm, Cat-nivern, Eclentala, Pacllydernmta, and
Ii'amimmtia are absolutely without any known representatives in that exten-
sivc quai-ter of the globe. Such at least is the result to which our present
knowledge of Australian mammalogy conducts us3 for, Ι think, that there
are strong grounds for believing that the Dingo, or native dog, the only soli-
tary exception which can be adduccd against the universality of this position,
is not an aboriginal inhabitant of the continent, but a Subsequent importatum,
in all probability contemporary with the primitive settlemcnt of the natives.
Many circumstances might be advanccd in support of this opinion3 the sim-
ple fact of his anomaly is itself a strong corroboration of it; and his absence
