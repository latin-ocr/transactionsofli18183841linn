AMONGST a number of new and handsonie plants collected by Mr. Schoin-
hurgk on the mountain of Roraima, on the borders of British Gniana, one of
the most eurious is a speeies of Pitcher-plant, which he found growing in a
unu-shy savannah, at an elevation of about six thousand fect above the level
ot' the sea. As this plant is a new forin in a very distinct natural Order, the
Sarrareminsem, hitherto consisting of but one genus, and only six species, 1
have thought that the following short account of it might not be uninterent-
ing to the Linnean Society.

Like the true Sarraoenim this is an herbaeeous plant, with fibrous roots and
radical leaves, of which the petiole forins a long hollow tube or pitcher, open
at the top, and the lamina a small concave lid, which does not, however, as in
Nepentlzes, close over the piteher. The parallel veins of the piteher, with
transverse reticulations, and the thick texture and reticulate venation of the
lid, are the sanie in IIeliampltora as in Sarracenia.

A curious disparity in the texture of the reflexed hairs of the inner sui-face
of the piteher has been pointed out to me hy Dr. Lindiey, and Ι observe pre-
eisely the sanie structure in Sarracenia purpurea. The hairs which densely
close the mouth of the pitcher are thick, conical‚ and striated⁷ without any of
the ordinary appearanees of seereting haim, although this partos the leaf is
said, in Sarraeenia at least, to be generally covered with a saccharine exuda-
tion. At the bottom of the pitcher, and below the sinooth shining part (the
same in Heliamplzora as in Sarmenta), the scattercd hairs, sinaller than those
of the throat, but still reflexed, have all the appearance of ordinary secreting
hairs. They arise from a small tubercle, and appear to be coinposed otv a single
