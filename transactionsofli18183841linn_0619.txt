WHILE engaged 111 investigating the affinities of Disporzmz, my attention
was naturally directed to the exainination of various genera, either belonging
to Melantlzaeeoe, or to fainilies nearly related to it, and among others to the
two genera which form the subject of the present paper. In uiy former 00111-
111111110311011 I have already adverted to the new genus, of which Streptopus
{anztginosus is the type, and I have also noticed the position which it occupics
in the series of natural affinitics‚ and that the chain of connexion between
llIeltmtlmrece and Smilacew is rendered complete by means of it and Πίερον-11111,
The new genus in question agrees with Πίερον-11111 111 115 perianthium, in its
binary ovula, and in its habit and inflorescence3 but. it differs 111 the position
of its anthers, in its ovula being pendulous) and in its less decply separated
styles.

The genus Streptopus was first proposed by the elder Richard in Michaux's
Flora Boreali-Americana‚ and was intended to include not only the ζ Υ1·1ι]ανία
ampleoeifolia of Linnaeus, but two other plants thei-ein described for the first
time, namely, S. roseus and lanuginosus. The two last are exclusiver 0011»
fined to North America, while the first is common to Europe and Δ1111611011.

The characters of the genus consist in its hexaphyllous campanulate peri-
anthium, with the sepals deciduous, and farnished with a nectariferous furrow
at their base; erect sagittate anthei-s, with short dilated filainents3 three
separate stigmata3 and 111 its baccate pericarpium with polysperinous cells.
These characters will be found united in S. amplarffolius, which must be
considered as the type; and a careful compat-ison of it with the other species
included by Richard clearly shows that lanuginoszcs must be removed froin
the genus. The genus, as here proposed to be limited, will compi-ise S. am-
