sponding diminution in size. By the time that the young plant is furnished
with a pair or two of leaves the attachment will be found considerably firm.
1f we cut away the portions of thc support, and lay bare the included portion
os the parasite, we find that the application takes place entirely between the
ligneous systems of both, the fibres of the sucker-like root of the parasite
expanding on the wood of the support in the form of a psile (l'oie21‘. There is,
however, no interchangc of structure between the1n3 neither at this period is
there any intermixture of ligneous fibres. As soon as the young parasite has
acquired the height of two or three inches, when an additional supply ot'
nourislnnent is probably required, a laterai shoot is sent out, which is, espe-
cially towards the apex, of a green colour. This at one or two, and subse-
quently at various points, adheres to the support by means of sucker-like
productions, which are precisely similar in structure and in mode of attach-
ment to the original seminal oue.

As the parasite increases in size, these lateral shoots become frequently very
numerous, and give origin, 1 believe, always from those parts immediately
opposite to the sucker-like adhesions, likewise to stems and branches. During
the same period the fibres of the suckers become more and more imbedded in
the ligneous system of the support, owing to the deposition of the new wood
of the latter. The fibres of the parasite never penetrate beyond their original
attachment, although the later developed fibres appear to have the power ot*
arriving at this point, but no further. This is very remarkable. In the adult
plant the sucker-bearing shoots frequently run to a considerable distance:
many of the stocks being literally covered with parasites, all of which have
originated from one seed. 1 have seen such shoots, which had taken their
course along a decayed braneh, become reflexed, and return in quest, as I may
express it, of a part capable of affording due noui-ishment. In all the species
of Lei-anthus which I have examined the same phenomena occur, and also in
the species of Visemn from which the drawings were made. I have reason to
believe, however, that in some Lorantln· and Visca the attachment takes place
by one spot; in other words, that there is only a primary attachment: such
will approximate in form to the Viscum album.

The sucker-bearing shoots frequently run contiguous to each other, and are
