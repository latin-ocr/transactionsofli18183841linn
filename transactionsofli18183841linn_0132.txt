not thought it necessary to characterise the genera and sections, and must
refer to that work t'or full descriptions of them. Ι will not trouble the society
with any further observations, but proceed at once to the description of the

species.

Spica compacta densa basi interrupta laxiuscula, bracteis ovatis acuminatis

stem simple, striated‚ smooth, froin two inches to 1nore than a foot in height,
springing froin a thick perennial woody rhizonla. Leaves elliptical, often
so short as to be nearly round, and others on the same plant so much
elongated as to appear lanceolam, upon long stalks 3 their margins revo-
lute and marked with a series of short elevated transverse striae, so as to
appear crcnulated, the under side slightly downy, the cauline leaves lan-
ceolate and sessile. Stipules long, cylindrical, splitting laterally and
dilated at their top, with numerous nerves which are finely scabrons, or
rather, towards the top, very minutely spinoso-pubescent. Flowers small,
white, in dense compact spikes, the lower parts of which are more 01· less
elongated and interl-upted, and bear small bulb-like bodies in the place
of fruit; the true flowers are 5-fid‚ the segnients obtuse, stamens 8, the
filainents of which before the anthers burst are much shorter than the
calyX‚ afterwards they elongate until they nearly equal the styles which
are twice the length of the calyx, and usually th but in some cases
three in number3 bracteae longer than the pediceIS, acuminato, obliquely
truncate and cut; the pedieels jointcd just below the flower. Frait
rather large, lenticular7 compressed, the faces nearly round and pointed,
