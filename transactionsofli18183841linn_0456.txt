:380 Mr. HoGo's Observations οη tlte Spongilla fluviatilis,

Here, then, it will be apparent to every one how completely analogous the
locomotive germlike bodies of certain kinds of Sea Sponge are to those of the
River Sponge, and to the moving sporules of the club-shaped Ectosperma,
but with this exception, viz, that the first bodies are said to be endowed with
vibratory cilia. Nevertheless‚ I much desire that these bodies of 1116 different
Mai-ine Sponges, of which only a few species have been described by Pro-
fessor Grant, were again subjected to a more thorough and caresul investiga-
11011, 111 01·(161· 10 establish with greater certainty the presence and nature of
their supposed cilia 01· cilialike appendagcs Because, until a more intense
power of the microscope be brought to the examination of these bodies than I
can learn from the papers already referred to 111 1116 Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal& to have been at that time used, Ι cannot hold it to be by any means
decided whether those cui-rents there detailed be caused by real cilia or not.
And Ι am bound to state this as my opinion, yet with all due respect and
dcference to the able observations of Professor Grant, inasmuch as I have
11115611Ἰ been nearly misled in regarding the cui-rents issuing from the sides of
the locomotive sporules of the River Sponge, as being the vibrations of tufts
of cilia, as l have before mentioned, 111 consequence of using a microscope
made about thirty years ago, and 0116 of an inferior power; and had I not
been so fortunate as to have just had the opportunity of resubmitting some of
those same bodies to a more modern instrument of a considerably higher
power, Ι should unquestionably have declared that those sporules were fur-
nished with true cilia, and that the currents noticed by me were produced by
the vibratory motions of such cilia: whereas, in fact, their supposed cilia have
at length turned out to be merely papillae.

Wherefore‚ having thus escaped from an unavoidable error, I feel the neces-
sity of urging the re-examination of the locomotive germlike bodies of the Sea

brane: these buds, when viewed in the microscope, were rather hollow in the centre, from whence
a shoot pushed sorth.'' The germination also of the sporules of the River Sponge as observed by me,
and described in a preceding page, is remarkably similar.

* Dr. Grant appears 10 have used a magnifying power of less than even 100 times in those re-
searches3 for 116 there writes, “ Ι have used every effert in vain to detect them (polypi in the Sponge)
with a microscope magnifying nearly a hundred times.” Vide Edinb. New Phil. Journ. for 1827.

p. 126. It is superfluous to comment 00 the great improvements that have been made in microscopes
within the last twelve years.
