have gently touched, raised up, and punetured with blunt and sharp instru-

1 This is the Infusorian Proteus. I was not aware that Dr. Ehrenberg had already bestowed the
new name of Amoeba on that genus when Ι proposed that of Thetis for it. See my short communication
in 1116 Mag. Nat. Hist. vol. ii. N. S„ p. 53.

ᾧ Ι have lately read in the ‘¹ Revue Zoologique par la Societe Cuvierienne,’ (Paris, 1838, No. 9, for
last September, p. 204.) that M. Laurent esteems, as M. Dujardin does, the Sponqilloe to be true ani-
mals endowed with slow contractile movements.

ΙΙ In 1116 above-cited paper (p. 5.), Μ. Dujardin calls the Cliona celata a S120719i1cz‘re, which it 661·-
tainly is not, because Dr. Grant has himself not only seen but has also described its extraordinarily
minute polypes. (See Edinb. New Phil. Journ. for 1826, p. 8οι and Johnston’s Brit. Zooph.‚ p. 305.)
It is therefore a true Zoophyte, and what I may name, agreeably to the modern French nomenclature‚
an Alcyonidiaire, being most allied to the genus Alcyonidium of Dr. Johnston.
