336 Prqf. Oxvssn’s Description (ff tlte Lepidosiren annectens.

sponding eentral groovc and latei-al ridges in the concave articular surface of
the lower jaw. Moreover‚ this double articulat· trochlea is not bony but car-
tilaginous in both the pcdicle and the lower jaw. The convex or upper part
of the joint forms the termination of an elongated piecc of cartilage continued
from that which represents the ssplaino-temporal bone, (lownwards and for-
wards, between the expanded end of the ptcrygoid plate above-described,
which forins its internal support, and an elongatcd plate of bone, which runs
parallel with the cartilaginous pcdicle and adheres to its outer side. This
outer plate of bonc may be regarded as a rudimental os zfiismpanicztmssz its
inferior extremity is regularly convex, and forins the outer cdge of the inan-
dibular arti‹⁷·ulation: above this part it becomes coum-acted, and, as it were,
twisted‚ with the posterior edge turned outwards, so as to render itsv external
surfaee concave; it then again becomes expandcd and compressed, as it as-
eends obliqucly backwards and terminatos in a rounded edge, which gradually
degenerates into cartilage.

Each ramus of the lower jaw is coinposed of an articular 01· post-mandibu-
lar† and a ‹lentat-y piece ‡‚ asin most osscous fisth. The articular piece is an
elongatcd eompressed bone, eoncave posterior-ly whcrc it forms the outer mar-
gin of the articular surface, and extending forwards in a groove on the outer
and near the lower part of the dentary piccc; it ends in a point near the syn]-
physis. The cartilage, which forins the principal part of the articulat· conca-
vity, extends forwards on the inner side of the postmandibular bone half-way
towards the symphysis. The ‹lentary clements arc anchyloscd to each other
at the &mpla-sis, and each is decply notched behind for the reception os the
apex of the postmandibular bone. Their masticating or upper surface is ino-
ditied in correspondence. with the dental surfacc of the opposed jaw2 three
trenehant ridges radiate from the syniphysis, the anterior being like that in the
upperjaw the slim-test and thickest, and with the external angle most pointed
and produced, adapted for piercing and tearing; thc posterior one is the thin-
nest, and best fitted for cutting: the two anterior dentary ridges in each ramus
of the lower jaw work into the notehes between the ridges of the jaw above.

Behind, and nearly parallel with the m· &liupana-mn, is placed an elongated
slender trihedral bone, pointed at both 011‹ls‚ having a slight Sigmoid curva-
