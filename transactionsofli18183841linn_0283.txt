diversity of form in the fruit, arising only during its growth from the state of
ovary, is rather a generic than an ordinal distinction.

Resides this differenee in the fruit, δ’ᾔιχηιω and *S'trigilia have. a definite
number of statuens, but their insertion and connexion at the base into a short
tube is the same as in «Symplocos and Halesi«.

The character of Halesiacfw derived from the winged fruit loses what little
importance might have been given to it, when it is considered that it is not
the “ nut'’ itself that is winged‚ but merely the calyx inclosing it, which in its
development becomes fleshy in §plumbet-os, and herbaceous and winged in
&desios—11 good generic, but no ordinal distinction.

Lindley, in the second edition of his Natural System, besides the above
genera, enumerates under Stzsraceoe the five following: [Nelidantlzera⁷ Mart„
Par-alea, Aubl.‚ Tur-aria, Molin.‚ ΑἸΙωνσΙω-ῐα, Llave, and I)ecadia‚L0u1-. Of
these, Diclidantlzera is the only one which is satisfactorily described, and
Martius is evidently right in ascribing it to Ebenaceoe3 but the separate inser-
tion of the anthers in the throat of the corolla remove it. from the tribe or
order of *S't-zsrstceoe: Parnlea and Decadia appear also, as far as can bc judged
from the very imperfect. descripfions, to be nearer the true Ebemtcew than to
Stis1·aceoe: [llorelosia must be very different, and may very likely belong to
Convolvzclaceoe, where Don places it.

With respect to the affinities of Styrarece as an order, their alliance with
Ebenaeeoe amongst Allonopelalw, and with Humiriaceoe in the first instance, and
in the next place with stleliaceoe, and perhaps with Amantiaoeoe and Olace'nea·
amongst Polypetczloe, has been already pointed out, and have only been eon-
firmed, as far as my observations have led me; but my object not being to
give a monogr-aph of the order, Ι now merely add the characters which I
should propose for such of the true *Sysmploci as I am acquainted with.
