Mr. BLACKWALL'S Descriptions qs new Species of Spiclers.

thorax3 the posterior row is longer than the anterior one, which is situ-
ated just above the frontal margin3 the intermediate eyes form a trape—
zoid, whose anterior side is the slim-test, those of the anterior row being
the smallest of the eight. Legs provided with hairs and sessile spines, a
longitudinal row of the latter occurring on each side of the inferior sur-
face of the tibial and metatarsal joints of the first and second pairs; their
colom· is yellowish brown ς fourth pair the longest, then the second, first
and third pairs nearly equal in length. Each tarsus is terminated by two
curved, pectinated claws, below which is a small elimbing apparatus.
Palpi short, with a small curved claw at their extremity3 in colour they
resemble the legs. Abdomen oviform, hairy, slightly depressed, project-
ing over the base of the cephalo-thorax3 it is yellowish brown, with a
dark reddish brown band above, extending nearly half its length from
the anterior part along the middle, the interval between the posterior ex-
tremity of the band and the spinners being occupied by a series of trian-
gular spots of the same hue3 on each side of the medial line is an irregular,
interrupted, longitudinal band of a dark reddish brown colour; margins
of the sexual organs‚ and three nurrow bands, situated between them and
the spinners, dark reddish brown. Plates of the spirae-les yellowish white.

The male resembles the female in colour. 1 have taken individuals of
this sex in autumn which had the terminaljoint of the palpi much en-
larged‚ but they evidently had not attained maturity, as the palpal organs
were not fully developed.

VVoods in Denbighshire and Caernarvonshire are the haunts of this species,

which, in summer, conceals itself among the foliage. 1 have captured females

in the month of June whose abdomens were greatly (listended with eggs.

Fam. CINIFLONIDAE.

These peculial-ities of structure, so strikingly characteristic, exercise a de-

eided influence upon the oeconomy of the Ciniflonidoe. The calamistra are
