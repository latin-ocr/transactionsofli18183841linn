ern parts of Europe, and abundantly in the polar regions of Europe, Asia, and
Amorion, as high as 71 (legrees of latitudo. It is also found on the chain of
the Caucasus in 420 north latitudo, being exantly in the sarno parallel with its
most southern lirnit in Europe, and likewise on the Altai mountaius, near the
