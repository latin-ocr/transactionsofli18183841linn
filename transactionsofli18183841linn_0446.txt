being deprived of light, after many days received no green tint, but continued
of a light buff or a yellowish white colour. Thus, then, by the exactly similar
influence of light upon the cl11·omule*‚ or colouring matter in plants, and like·
wisc by the etiolation, or blanching of vegetables by the absence of light, so
well known to every one, very favourablc proofs may, from these analogous
phenomena, be most rcasonably adduced with regard to the vegetable nature
of the Spongilla“flzwl'atl'liffl

The circumstances that led inc to the investigation of those appearances
are described in a paper†‚ which at the date of my former letter to you had
not been read before the Royal Society, to whom Ι was induced to communi-
cate it. I therefore did not consider myself then at liberty to make any men-
tion of thcm to you; although they, together with some observations on the
seedlike bodies of the iS'Jumgilla, already described in that letter, created in my
mind considerable doubts as to the animality of that substance. Renewed and
similar observations upon several fresh and living masses of the River Sponge).
during the summer which has just passed, have now confirmed me in the cor-
rectness of those doubts, and in the certainty of those facts which afford the
stronger proofs of the real vegetability of that Sponge. Of such proofs, indeed,
which I was then about to pronounce as quite conclusive on that point, are the
effects that Ι had noticed‚ caused by the presence and absence of light, upon
the colours of that substance, the. germination of its seedlikc bodies, sporidiz-1, or
sporulcs, aud their subsequent plantlike mode of growth and of increase; and
whilst engaged in these lesem-elles, Ι was greatly surpriscd in discovering (on
the 1⁴2th of August, 1838) the only traces that could with any degree of pro-
bability be advanced in favour of the supposed animality of the Spongilla,
namely, certain remarkable gcrmlike bodies swimming about in the basin of
water, wherein a beautiful mass of that Sponge‚ growing with great vigour and
attached to a stone, was contained. At first Ι was disposed to think that they
