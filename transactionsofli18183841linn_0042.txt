appearance very different from that which wc find in ACHNODON. Gaudin
and Kunth describe a snbulate rudiment to several species, but except 111
P. Michelii I have not been able to detect it. In ΡΙιΙθιιηι1 Germ-(li of Villars
I can discern no inner palea3 and I think in habit as well as 111 the dorsal
awn of the palea it agrees better with Alopecen-us than with Plzleum.

ALOPECURUS. Ι11 501110 species of this genus the glumes are united at the
base, and in some the inner cdges of the single palea are united so as to form
a tubular corolla, but neither of these characters runs through the genus.
Cnvpsm is placed by Kunth among the Phalaridew, and its dense panicle has
obliged me to place it here, but its comparatively large and firm palene might
perhaps vindicate for it 0 station among the Agro.›·ticlece. These tribes, how-
ever, are so closely allied that I have more than once doubted the propriety of
keeping them separate. The 111111 paleae and dense spike unite in induc-ing ine
to transfer GASTRIDIUM from the Agros-lidae to 11115 tribe. Palisot de Beauvois,
indeed, ascribes to this genus coriaeeous paleae; and Sir J. E. ›Smith by his
remarks on stlHium, with which he unitcs it, seems to hold the same opinion.
I find, however, the paleae of both specics to be as described by Kunth ‘⁶ te-
nuiter iliclnbranaceae,” and that 111 011 stages.

Some specics of Polypogrm might seem to belong to this tribe, but we cannot
divide the genus. The ce121pa1·atively strong geniculate and twisted dorsal
awn ‘5⁴‘ Lagarzes, with the two lengthened points of the outer palea, show it
to belong to the Avenaceoe.

This tribe is rather formed to contain all the single-flowered Grasses Which
will not enter into any of the other tribeS, 111011 05 uniting plauts having a
very distinct character of their own. They are all small plants, with 0 panicle
of fine and almost capillary 111-01101105, 011(1 5111011 flowers and seeds. The
glumes are too large 111 proportion to suffer the student to search for the
species among the Orjzszeoe, except, indeed, in (bleantlms, where they are
