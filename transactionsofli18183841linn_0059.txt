genus, with a tendency to become geniculate and twisted‚ and rises from about
the middle of the back of the bicuspidate palea. In this it is a seta from near
the extremity of the entire palea. This, iu words, seems amply sufficient; but
on examining the specics, each of the characters is sometimes so slightly
marked, that the student is at a loss to know to which genus a plant may
belong.

The large glumes of Smnsms might induce us to put it with the Avelim-ew.
The llorets5 cylindrical and truncate, and bluntly ribhed towards the extremsty,
bring· it near to S‹·ler0clzl‹m. Liunzeus considered it as a Festum, and De
(fandolle placed it with Koelsria, with which it lias very little atliuity. Palisot
(le Beauvois marks a small terminal seta which I (lo not observe.

Mamm, like schistam, has large glumes, and neither awn nor seta. The
one-sided infloreseence aud linear seed favour its arrangement with the Fes-
tucacmr, and its habit is very different from that of the Acenarew. Yet in this
respect it divides itself into two parts, Jl.t·1·liata and M. Buuleini presenting a
very different appearance from the wide-spreading branches of All.‹¹1.s·pera,
M. minuta, and M. anfflora. In Melina villata I usually find the second floret
barren, aud the third so small as to be exposed with difficulty. Both unite
to form the club-like rudimcnt which characterizes the genus. Hlelica per-
sica is said to have 6 florets, of which the lower alone is perfect. ΜΟΙΛΝΙΑ
seems well divided from Melica. thether Festum serotina be rightly placed
with it may admit of a doubt. It must mainly depend on whether the paleae
harden or not on the secds.

CATABROSA is a very distinct genus, which has nothing in common with
Afra, with which it was formerly united, but the number of its florets

In Sasmnm, the large and almost scariose glumes and the three οι· five nerves
‹›f the outer palea, each running beyond its scariose membrane into a short
point, clearly mark the genus. We can hardly conceive this structure united
to a true awn, and therefore have no hesitation in placing it among the Fes-
tucacece. Nono of the Avenacese have a clearly marked point or seta eonti—
nuing from the inner nerve of the outer palea. The united styles and long
stigmas are probably important; yet Kuntli says, ‘⁶ styli duo, breves.'' Ses-
leria disticha, or Poa disticha, as it has sometimes been called, wants both
these characters, and agrees better with Poa, with which it has been united
