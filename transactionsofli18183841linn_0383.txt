THE szcece, like the other Glumaceous families, but especially the (ypera-
ceoe and Gramineoe, have a very wide geographical range, extending through-
out the globe from the equator to the polar regions, and affording examples
of the occurrence in both hemispheres of the same species, or at least of
forms too closely allied to admit of their being ranked as distinct species, as.
for instance szczcs effusus and maritimus, and Luzula campestris3 but the
Cyperaceoe afford still more numerous examples, and among others may be
mentioned Careoe coespitosa and Psemlo-Cfesperus, Gladium. mariscus, Scit-lm*
lacustris, triqueter, and maritimus, Isolepisssfluitans and setacea.

The number of Species collected by Dr. Royle in Northern India is eight, of
which seven belong to szczcs, and one to Lauda. This last is common to
Europe, the northern parts of Asia, and Greenland. Of the seven Junci three
are entirely new, two are identical with those contained in the Wallichian
Herbarium, and two are generally diffused throughout Europe.

The linear, erect anthers, attached by their base to the filaments, and com-
posed of two parallel cells, connate throughout their entire length, and their
filiform, longitudinally papillose stigmata, combined with their habit and nar>
row sheathing leaves, clearly establish a close relationship between the normal
Junceoe and Cyperacece, notwithstanding the reduced condition of the perian-
thium and ovarium, the uninclosed embryo, and entire leaf-Sheaths in the
latter family.

The szceoe evidently form the transition from the Glumaceous to the Peta-
loid Monoeotyledons, being connected on the one hand by Narthecimn with
Aspltodelece and Melanthos-ece, by Kingia and Calectasia with Commelineae and
