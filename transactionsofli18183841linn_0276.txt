224 Mr. Bmch-WALL on the Mammulae qs Spiders in Spimiing.

a State of reposo. Their figure is somewhat conieal, but compressed and
truncate, so that the base and apex are elliptieal with long transverse axes.
Consisting of a single joint only, eaeh manunula is connected with the other
throughout its entire length, the extremity alone being densely covered with
exeeedingly minute papilhe, which emit the viseous matter that is formed into
the pale. blue hands, constituting the most important part of the snare of this
spider, by means of the eomhing or rather eurling instrument, which I pro-
pose to name calamum-1011 ’Κ IIaving deteeted the connexion subsisting between
the new spinners and the calamistrzon, Ι confidently anticipated that spiders
provided with the latter would likewise possess the fornici-3 and such I found
to be the ease on examining Di-assm· 1=i›-i‹li.‹.s·inms, lValelx‘„ Drassus parvulus,
Blackw„ and Drassas (arigisus, Blaekw. MS„ which, together with Clubiona
atrox, are the only speeies at present known to have the metatarsal joint of the
posterior legs surnished with the eurling apparatus†.

Thus it appears that spiders provided with calamistro have eight spinnei·s;
and as it has been demonstrated that the Superior mammulae, though modified
in form, always perform the office of spinners, it, follows that spiders with six
mammulae, eoinprising mueh the greater number of genera, and those with
four mammulae, eemstituting a few genera only, flljlgllle and Oletera, for
example, have preeisely as many spinners as manunulae.

those spiders in which it is found remains to be discovered.

* A description and figures of the calamistrum are published in the 'I'ransaetions⁴ of the Linnean
Society, vol, xvi. p. 473—4. tab. xxxi. fig. ⁸2. 3.1n the same volume, p. 476, an account is given
of a strong, moveable spine inserted near the termination of the tarsus of each posterior leg, on the

under side, in spiders belonging to the genus Epeiro, which I propose to denominate sustentamlum.
