inferior spinner of Drassus ater, which can he wholly retraeted within the
middle joint at. the will of the spider³ Ι snbjected numerous individuals to a
strict scrutiny, when Ι was surprised to discover that the number varied with
the age of the animals. In Speeimens which had attained nearly a third of
their growth they 1151111111*11111011111611 to five 01· six: in others, which were about
two-thirds grown, to §ix or seven3 and in adult& which had acquired their
full complement, they were uniformly eight: two of them, situated on the in-
ferior surface of the spinner, at a greater distance from its extremity than the
rest, being minute and almost contigimus. It is a fact deserving of notice„
that, the papillae are not always developed siumltaneously on these spinners,
six, seven, or eight being sometimes observed on one, when five, six, or seven
only are to be seen 011 the othei-3 and this remark is applieable, not to the
inferior spiuners alone⁷ but to the intel-mediate ones also, which, in mature
individuals, are further modified by having the extremities of the terminal
joints directed forwards at right angles to their bases. Ι have, in like man—
ner, ascertaiued that the papillae connected with the inferior spinners of
Drusi-us capreus, Blaekw.‚ and the superior spinners of *S'cgestria πηοί-(ΛΜΗ,
follow the same law of development3 but whether it does 01· does not hold
good with the papilla* 011 the spinning mannnulae of spiders in general, Ι am
not at present prepared to decide; yet, could Ι rely on analogy, and on the
results of observations, too limited and imperfect to command implicit 6011-
fidence, Ι should he disposed to answer allirmatively. The iuquiry, however,
to which I am solicitous to direct the attention of arachnologists, is one of
considerable interest.

In addition to the papillae 011 the terminal joint of the superior spinners of
Il'alcltenaem acmninata, a large 0116, 11111611 (lilated at its base, occurs near the
extremity of their middle joint, on the inner sui-face.

The superior and inferior spinuers of many spiders are triarticulate; and
when the terminal joint of the former is greatly elongate-d, thiekly elothed
with hairs, and tapers to a point; the papillae, in the form of hair-like tubes,
dilated at the base, are commonly distributed along its inferior surface, as in
the case of Tegeum-icc domestica, rngmmria civilis, Agclemt labyrinthica, Ter-
lriw agilis, l)ra.s.su.s sawtilis, Blackw„ and some other British species, This
deviation from the prevailing structure has indueed Lyonnet, Savigny‚ Trevi-
