510 Mr. Simu-H on a Plan! which produces perfect Seeds

and the similarity of the offspring to the parent would alone lead me to con-
clude that it is not the result of cross-secundation. The circumstances con-
nected with the situation of the plant in the garden, and the absence of allied
male plants, as also the peculiarity of the natural order to which it belongs,
which do not readily hybridize, led me to believe that no foreign pollen had
fecundated the ovarium; and on watching the progress of the stigma all
doubts were removed. The inflorescence 15 produced 011 1110 apex of small
laterai branchos in spikes of generally from three to five or more flowers: in
its early stage, a reddish (1150 15 50011 50111011 1111111111 five or six small, subulate,
villose, erect sepals; and on examination the (1150 15 found to be a dilated,
three-lobed, sessile stigma, and the sepals to be placed around the base of the
ovarinm. Each flower is seated on a thick, very short pedicel, stuclded 1111111
from one to four or five round, prominent, papilliform, shining glands, from
which, in the young state, exndes a colonrless viscid fluid. This fluid remains
for some time on the sui-face of the glands in the form of a globule, and the
terminal flower always has the greatest number of glands. The ovarium is
three-celled, each cell containing one 01111111111, attached to the apex of the
inner angle of the cell; and 111 1110 0011150 of four 01· five months the seeds are
perfected and discharged with 01115110 force from the capsule; the whole pre-
senting the usual structure of Euphwbiacew, such as it occurs in Croton,
Plusllantlms, Chastia, &cz I have already said, that the stigma consists of
three connate lobes, which are more or less notched; at first the lobes are
depressed on the ovarium, 11111 as the ovarium 51110115 they lose their reddish
0010111· and become inclined upwardS, retaining their succulent and healthy
appearance till dried up by the ripening of the fruit: the surface has a granular
appearance, derived from minute papillae, and showing 110 signs of having been
acted upon by pollen. Spiral vessels occur in the thick part of the base of the
stigma, and are doubtless connected with the vascular tissue of the ovarium.
I have seen nothing like pollen-tubes. The stiginatic sui-face remaining so
long unchanged affords a strong proofof its not having been acted upon by
pollen, it being well known that the stigma of many plants remains for a long
time unaltered, but soon after the application of pollen a change takes place,

On considering the circumstances above noticed, and in particular the
