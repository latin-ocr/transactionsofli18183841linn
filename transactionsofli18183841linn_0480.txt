des plantes marines donnant par l'incineration, des odeurs et des produits
analogues ἓι ceux des animauxssl⁹ Neithcr is the presence of ammonia in
these substances at all conclusive of their animal nature; for Ι have before
mentioned that some plants contain nitrogen or azote, and from the combi-
nation of this ingredient with hydrogen the ammonia itself is fornicd3 where-
fore in those vegetables, especially in the lower water-plants, which contain
nitrogen, more or less of ammonia is known to be generally produced.

Thus it. seems that there really exists no more peculiarity in the chelnical
composition of Sponges†, than what is also present in that of certain vegeta-
ble substances. And for the sake of corroborating this, 1 will cite the follow-
ing authority from a naturalist, equally illustrious in botany and in zoology,
who, describing Sponges as animals, nevertlieless allows, ‘⁴ chymicis etiam
principiis paulo similiores plantis deprehenduntur‡.''

To me then it is evident, that the Sea Sponges being so perfectly analogous
in every part of their structure with the Freshwater Sponges, it is impossible
that they can be separated from one and the same natural order, or accounted
as the one pertaining to the animal kingdom, and the other to the vegetable.
And as Ι have become convinced that¹ the River Sponge is a true member of
the latter, and as I have endeavoured so to demonstrate this in the preceding
pages of my present letter, Ι must now necessarily be compelled to acknow-
ledge myself a convert to the vegetability of the Sea Sponges. In the full
confirmation of this, and in the absence of more direct proofs, which may yet
be derived from future researches on these marine productions, whilst growing
in their native localities, I will concisely 511111 up in a general manner the fol-
lowing evidence of their want of animal life, or what I may term their non-
animality. They have no tentacles‚ 110 cilia, no mouth, no oesophaguS, no
stomach or gasti-ic sac, no gizzard, 110 alimentary canal, no intestine, no
1111115, 110 ovaria, no ova, no musclcs or muscular fibres, no nerves or ganglia,

† But the discovery of iod'me in the Sea Sponges determines that they more nearly resemble the
Fuci in their chemical composition. Consult the article “ 10de¹' at p. 594. tom. xxiii. of the Diction-
naire (165 Sciences Naturelles (Paris, 1822), which was written by M. Chevreul, Professor of Chemistry.
-Ι only became acquainted with this fact on December 7th, 1839. J. H.
