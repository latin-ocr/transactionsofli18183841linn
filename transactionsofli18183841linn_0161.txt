and though the imperfect nature of the matcrials at my disposal enables me
rather to excite than satisfy the curiosity which naturally attaches to the sub-
ject, Ι may be permitted to indulge a hope that the present notice will at least
attract the attention of future inquii-ers, and be the means of procuring more
detailed and accurate information.

That a vast majority of the terrestrial quadrupeds of Australia belong to
the Marsupial family, a group in a great measure peculial· to that locality,
and altogether anoinalous in relation to the Mammals of other quarters of
the globe, is a fact too well known to require further illustration. At the
same time, the exceptions to this general rnle are much more numerous than
has been hitherto suspected: it is true, indeed, that only five, or at most six
species of Monadelphine quadrupeds have been hitherto described as indi-
genous to that extensive continent; but the evidence which Ι shall produce
in the present memoir gives us every reason to anticipate an extension of the
number, whilst it establishes the singular and hitherto unlooked-for fact, that
these exceptions belong exclusively to the Rodent order. Of the five or six
inonodelphine species already known to share this common habitat with the
Marsupial family, one is the Diago, or native dog, which, as Ι have observed
above, should in all probability he expunged froin the catalogue of aboriginal
aniinals3 three belong to the extensive and cosmopolite genus Mum and the
remaining one, or, perhaps⁷ two species, constitute the genus Hesdronigss of
M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, the only nonmarsupial form hitherto described as
peculial· to Australia.

Under these circumstances, the announcement of any addition to t'ne indi-
genous Rodents of that country becomes 111 itself a matter of sufficient im-
portance3 but the discovery of new forms and genera, either altogether
unknown, or hitherto [insuspected to exist 111 that quarter of the globe, in-
vests the subject with more than ordinary interest, and whilst it enlarges the
bounds of science, demonstrates the universality of those inscrutable laws
which regulate the geographical distribution of animal life. It is, therefore,
with feelings of more than common satisfaction that I present this memoir,
however necessarily imperfect, to the notice of the Linnean Society3 more
especially, as it affords me an opportunity of acknowledging my personal
obligations to a gentleman to whom science and his country are equally in-
