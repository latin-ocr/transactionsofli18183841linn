2. Another view ofa nnion of sporules in their first stage.
03. A union in its second stage: the mother-cell is now visihle 2—magni-
fied 150 times.

. 34. An abortire sporule in tho third stage :—magnified 121) times.

Fig. 35. An abortivo sporule after it has acquired its onter Com, hut before

the coat has become thick enough to obscure the lines on the spo*
rulo.

w. 36. An abortive sporule in its final shape.

.07. Fertile spornle in the third stage. Three of the spornles arc rup-

tured; the other is enlarged2——magnified rather more than lo«)
times.

. 38. A union ofsporules from a fertile theca, in which all four of the spo-
rnles are rnptured.

‹·. 39. Is the same as· fig. 37, hut more advaneed; the spornle is consider-

ahly enlarged and of a pyriform Shape; the mother-cell is consider-
ably dilated.

AO. A more advanced sporule. There is a considerable deposition of
matter aronnd the npper part of the spon-ule, and also a beginning
at the larger extremity. The three ruptured sporules have disap-
peared :—1nagnified 54 times.

·. 41. A still more mature sporule.

·. 42. A ripe spornle in its theca removed from the involucrum. The

action of the water in which it was examined on the gelatinous
covering, and its being removed from the pressure of the other
thecae, have caused the theca to swell and assume a roundish figure
a. One of the four visihle nnions of ruptured sporules.
