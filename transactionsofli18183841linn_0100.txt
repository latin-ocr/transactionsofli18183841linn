subjects under consideration this body is naked.

There isan evident resemblance between the nipple-shaped process of vis-

The only species in which this has been studied in any detail is the Viscum
albam„ and even here the statements are not altogether satisfactory. The
latest account which I have seen is that of De Candolle in his excellent Phy-
siolngie Ve'ge‘tale, vol. ii. p. 790, and more fully in vol. iii. p. 1409, where the
subject is treated in the usually luminous manner, so characteristic of this
distinguished author.

The mature seeds of all the species of Lar-anthus adhere strongly to the
substance on which they are applied by means of the viscous matter. This
viseum soon hardens, and then has the appearance of a transparent glue. The
first changes take place in L. Sem-ula two or three days after application,
and consist of a curvature of the extremity of the radicle towards the sup-
port; this extremity when it reaches this point becoming enlarged and flat-
tened†.

It has now the appearance of a sucker, such as those, for instance, of the
Oct-mpsim filtformis. I am unable to state the precise manner in which the
radicle penetrates the bark. The operation seems to require some time, and
it is not until it is completed that the plumula begins to be (leveloped. In
those species the eotyledons of which are soldered together, the plumula
passes out by one of the elefts3 in the others by the fissure between these
two bodies. The cotyledons in all the species I have examined reinain in-
elosed in the albumen, which substance begins to disappear as soon as the
plumula commences to he developed3 the cotyledons undergoing a corre-
