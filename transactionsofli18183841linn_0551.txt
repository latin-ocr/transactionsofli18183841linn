Another argument against the ergot being a fungus is, that the reproductive
particles are most numerous when it is young, and it continues its growth
after their production has ceased, which is contrary to the usual law amongst
that class of vegetable beings ; for their efforts to live are only to develop the
means of their propagatim), commencing to decay the instant this act has been
accomplished.

Resides these proofs, ehemieal analysis shows its dissimilarity in composition
with Fungi generally, and even with the species of &clm-otium (a genus to which
the Ergot was assigned by DeCandolle and Fee) on account of its containing
very different constituents, the following being those given by Vauquelin in
his analysis of the Ergot :—

Colouring matter: soluble in alcohol.

1171ite oil: very abundant ; sweet.

l'iolet matter: soluble in water.

FLred plzosplzoric aeid.

. :zotized matter: very abundant, and alterable.

Free anzmonia: at looO Reaumur.

The fact of having caused the sporidia to grow unconnected with the ergot,
and without assuming any form in the least degree analogous to it, is another,
and the most substantial and convincing proof that the sporidia ‹lo not belong
to that body, but are joints or portions of microscopic plants, which select the
grains of many grasses as a suitable matrix for their development. There
are other proofs of the separate existence of this microscopic plant; for it is
not found exclusively on the body of the grain, but has been observed to tiou-
rish on other parts of the same grass, but occasioning in such situations no
exuberant growth, for obvious reasons, because these parts have completed
their development before the fungus makes its appearance; and their struc-
ture is not like that of the grain, which, at the period of attack, is exceedingly
young, and, commencing to grow rapidly, is susceptible of impressions which
ean easily pervert its form and structure.
