Mr. BLACKWALL'S Descriptions of new Species of Spiclers.

robust and nearly straight, greatly resembling those of the Linyphioe
Lip semicircular and prominent at the extremity. These parts are ofa
reddish brown colour, the sternum being rather the darkest, and the
mandibles, maxillze and lip the reddest. Eyes placed on black spots.
Legs aud palpi reddish brown3 first and fourth pairs of legs the longest
and equal in length, third pair the shortest. Abdomen oviform, thinly
covered with hairs, convex above, projecting over the base of the cephalo—
thorax3 it is of a dull brown colour, obscurely mottled with darker
brown. A depressed, oval, flesh-coloured protuberance is connected
with the sexual organs. Plates of the spiracles yellowish white.

The male, which is rather smaller than the female, has the cephalo-
thorax, legs, palpi, mandibles, maxillae and lip red, with a slight tinge
of brown; moreover, the abdomen is darker coloured than that of the
female. The relative length of the legg also, is different in the sexes, the
male having the first pair longer than the fourth. Third and fourth

joints of the palpi short, the latter being much the stronger and some-

what produced in front3 fifth joint of an irregular, oval form, having a
large lohe on the outer side; it is convex and hairy externally, concave
within, comprising the palpal organs, which are prominent, highly deve-
loped, complicated in structure, exhibiting several strong, corneous pro-
eesses: one of which, situated at the extremity, is curved, pointed and
enveloped in a semitransparent membrane, and a large one, at the upper
part, projects two branchos, one directed upwanls, extending nearly to
the articulation of the third and fourth joints, and the other directed
‹hiwnwards3 both are pointed and curved outwards, an obtuse promi-
nence occurring near the base of the latter, within the curve: these
organs are of a reddish brown colour. The convex sides of the terminal
joints are directed towards each other.

Adult specimens of this spider, which is very nearly allied t0 the Lingspltice

by the structure of the mouth and the disposition and relative size of the eyes,

were discovered under stones at Crumpsall Hall, in October 1836.
