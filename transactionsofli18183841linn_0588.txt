theca (ΤΑΒ. XXXV. fig. 8.)‚ we shall find that the space between the thecal
and sporular memhranes communicatos with the loose tissue in connexion
with the stomata, so that the air has free aec-ess to the opposing sui-faces of
those memhi·anes; and it is a fact, that all the tissue thus exposed to the
action of the atmosphere contains green granules, whilst in those parts of the
tissue, the columella for instance, which may he supposed to hc inaccessible to
the air, the granules are smallrr and colom-lesen* The proof is then satisfac-
tory, that the last-described laver is the onter surfaee of the sporular mem-
brane, which consists of certainly not more than two layers of cells3 for Ι
am confident, from the great, number of species which I have examined in all
stages of their growth, that this thicknczs of the spzwular incinbrane is never
exeecded. 1 have, in many species, had a difficulty in deeiding whether there
were more than one layer, but never that there were not more than two. It
follows, then, that the next layer, after eounting two for the sporular mem-
hrane, will either he the colunnella or a tissue occupying the. sporular eavity.
That this last is the truth, is proved hy the fact of the sueeeeding layer being
eomposed of decided spornles. The cells forming the layer which intervenes
between the sporules and the sporular memhrane are tinged with yelloxv, in
which respect they res‘emhle the sporulcs before they have arrived at> ma-
turity3 and between the columella, which is composed of coloni-less cellules,
and the layer of spornles7 are two rows of cells, also coloured yellow similar
to the last, and also occupying the sporular eavity. In this stage the sporules
already formed consist of a disjointed cell containing a quantity of grumous
granular matter. In some of the cells the grains are uniformly seatteoed, and
in others they hegin to arrange themselves in groups around four grains ot'
larger development (TA-n. XXXV. fig. ld), which ultimately become four di-
stinct sporules contained in a mother-cell. It is perfectly certain that the
single row ot' ¹<pondes which exists in this stage is not equivalent to the
thousands of sporules which exist at the time of maturity5 and it therefore
follows that more must be formed. Now as it has heen already proved that
the yellow cellules oceupy the sporular cavity‚ and as they are exaetly similar

* This remark, that the columella does not contain green grimolffi, must not he understood as

generally applicahle, for there are many species in which the columella is crowded with green gra-

nules.
