JUIJ: BAUER οη the Ergot ongse. 479

Galen mentions fever, delirium, gangrenous 1110015, &c., occasioned by it:
011(1Το55101 gives the results of many experiments, which not only confirm
what Galen said of the ill effects the erg-ot has upon the human frame, but
he also ascertained that it produces the same ill effects upon the health
of 111-11105, 511011 05 dogs, swine, and poultry,—which all instinctively refuse
to eat the ergot of rye3 bnt by disguising 11, and by foreibly feeding them with
it, 110 found the same injurious and frequently fatal effect was produced on
these animals as that on the human species.

The discovery of the very beneficial and almost wonderful medicinal quali-
ties of the ergot of rye 15 11111 of very recent (101ος Το55101·, about 1783, says
“It 15 asserted by some that it is successfully employed in hastening labour,
and in pleurisy;” but, he observes, “those 05501110115 010 1101 011111011110010(1;
011(1 even if they were true, they would not disprove the injurious qualities it
has iu 011101· cases, and under other circumstances?

Dr. Stearns, of New York, seems to be the first who found the ergot of rye
to be the most efficacious remedy 111 00505 of protracted labour and excessive
haemorrhage3 111 511011 cases, about 1522, he employed it most suceessfully,
and 511100 11101 111110 11 1105 110011 almost generally adopted 111 11115 country with
equal success. The periodical publication, The Laneet, since 1828 to this time,
recor-ds many 111051 interesting· and successful cases, reported by eminent and
extensive praetitioners, from which it appears, that the lives of many patients,
whose cases had been considered hopeless, have been saved by the instanta-
neous effects of this substance.

The ergot of rye 15 now an article provided 111 every dispensary3 and since
its important and beneficial medicinal quality is ascertaine<l‚ even if 011 efficient
remedy for preventing this disease were known, it would not be advisable to
extirpate it; and there 15 110 doubt, that, when those valuable qualities of the
ergot get generally known among· the cultivators and farmcrs, and that a
bushel of ergots will probably feteh more than four or five bushels of the finest
rye, they will think it worth their while to collect, and carefully separate, the
ergots from the corn3 by 50 doing, they would not only be compensated for
their trouble by the sale, but at the same time purify the corn, and thus pre-
vent the pernicious effects of the ergot.
