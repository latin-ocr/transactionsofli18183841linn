grie-anti, fasciis binis ochraceis notato, prima ante medium disci posita
atque ad suturam vix extensa, secunda integra at latiori. Corpus infra
ochraeeo-flavum, pubescentia subaurata obsitum. Pedes femoribus fusco-
flavis, tibiis tarsisque pallidioribus.

This insect also inhabits Assam, and is in the collection of Mr. Solly. It is
named iu honour of its discoverer Mr. Griffith, an acute and enterprising
botanist, author of a valuable memoir on the Development of the Ovulum of
Sz‘mtalum and Lei-anthus, printed in the 18tl1 volume of the Society's Trans-
actions.

The clothing of this species Ι ean only compare to an inferior velvet or a
sort of plush3 when rubbed it exhibits the appearance of bronze, and in places
it resembles a rose-coloured copper. It is remarkable for a peculiarity of
colom-ing, which Ι regard as of very rare occurrence. It appears as if the
eolouring matter of the second fascia had run, and had overwhelmed the black

the yellow-oehre taking its place.

Ruhei· ; antennis corpore duplo longioribus, thorace elytrisque nigro-maculatis,
pedibus eoncoloribus. Caput antiee nigrum, postice rubrum. Antennce
longissimae, nigrae. leoruoe disco rubro, spinis utrinque atris. Elytra
rubra, humeris, somello, maculisque variis nigris sparsim dispositis.
Corpus infra nigrum, pectore, segmentis abdominis utrinque rubro-ma-
culatis. Pedes ειη-ἰ, plantis fusco-spongiosis.

The above speeies, remarkable in its coloni-ing, is also from Assam. I know
of no species allied to it. The red colour, after the death of the inseet‚ changes
to a pale orange. I have seen some speeimens so bleaehed by the light that
casual observers would regard them as distinct species.
