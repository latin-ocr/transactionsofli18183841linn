The circumstance of buds being developed upon leaves is by no means So
rare an occurrence as Dr. Schleiden supposes3 for not only ansoplnsllum,
hut Kabom-hoe, Roelwa, Ecba-oria, and other genera of crassulae-ew, are well
known to be readily propagated by their leaves, which give birth to buds, and
where care has been taken to eut them off above the point ot' insertion, so as
to avoid the possibility of any portion of the axis adhering to them. The seg-
ments of the leaves of (Pte-(lamine pratensis and ιιηιυνα separate from the mid-
rih in autumn, take root, and give birth to a young plant. [n the autumn of
15:36, while walking round the gardens of the Marquis of Ailesbury at. Tot-
tenham Park, Wilts, I was much gratilied hy observing a number of plants of
a variety of the common Cabbage (Brassica olet-acea) having their leaves
eovered with innumerable bnds on the upper surfaee along the costa· and
veins. The petiole and lamina of sueh leaves in other respects presented the
ordinary appearanee. llut the most eonvincing proof of the origin of ovula
from the carpellary leaves is atl'orded hy a singular variety of the common
iVallflower ((ἸιρίνιυιΙΙιηκ Clwiri), first observed by ΜΓ. ssrown, in which the
stamina are cmiverted into open eonlluent carpels, which bear ovula at their
margins& These facts go clearly to prove the. correctness of the opinion which
derives the ovula from the carpellary leaves3 and Ι am (lislmsed to think that
the ease of the Yew (Tamus), singular as it is, will not he found to be an
exeeption to the general law. l might also notice the female infioreseencc
ot (fiscus, which is elearly a modified frond, although Ι am aware that the
mode of evolution ot' the fronds in that genus might be objected to their being
leaves.
