The uneertainty which 1105 50 long prevailed as to the plant which furnishes
the blowpipe-reed attests its scarcity: hut this is more strikingly manifested
by the circumstance that the other 1111110115 denote the Maiongcong and Gui-
nau tribes, who inhabit the only known regions where it grows, the Curata--
people. Nature has taught the. Indians of the Rio Negro and the Amazon,
who have 110 intercourse with the Curata-people, to find a substitute in a
slender palm, which they hollow out hy steeping the stem for some (lays in

does not grow in his neighbourhood.

exhaust the stock‚ if there were not two circumstances which render it very
unlikely that they will be exterminated. These are, the numerous 5110015
