10 Mr. W oons on tlte Genera of Europecm Grasses.

12. Rottboelliacew, ll genera, 3 of which occur within my limits, Nauius, Psi-
lurus, and Lepturus. This latter genus includes the European species
Of Rottlmellz'a.

13. Andrapogonew, 26 genera. Imperant, Effundam, and Amlropogtm are all

with which Ι am concerned. The last-mentioned genus is made by

Kunth to include Sorglmm of Smith.

Of this distribution we may observe, that thc structure of Lgsgenm is so
peculiar that we can hardly gain any thing by uniting it with others into a
particular tribe, and that Zea, although describedas havingan external neutral
floret in the fertile spicula, has yet no very striking general similarity with
Phalaris, and still less with --llopecurns and Phleum, or these with Halms and
slntlmoeanlltmn. Knappin‚ with its flowers on a one-sided rachis, may possibly
be more nearly allied to the Chlorideoe, where it. is placed by Reichenbach:
yet on the whole I am disposed to keep it in the neighbourhood of Agrosti.s·.
Among the Pam‘cew, Milizmz ‘fff‘ffl‘m seems oddly introduced between the two
closely allied genera Pas-palma and Panicum. To make out its claim to a
place in the Pam'cete> we. must suppose that of the two very similar outer
glumes, which are usually considered as forming the calyx, one only deserves
that name, while the other is to be taken as an abortive floret. These suppo-
sitions (unsupported by any peculiarities in the construction) may afford
grounds for ingenious speculatimis, but they can hardly be made use of as
parts of a generic character; or, to use the words of De Candolle, “ such an
hypothesis may he convenient if considered as an image or a metaphor, but
can hardly be allowed as an expression of reality.”

Kunth has not only scattered into three genera the species of the Linnean
genus Milium, but he has placed these in three different familics. Milium
efflas-mn, retaining the ancient name, is, as we have. just seen, put among the
Punicam M. coeruleseens, JI. paradooemn, διο. form the genus Piptatllerwn.
which is one of the Stipaseam and M. lendigerzmz, under the name of Gastri-
dium, is found among the Agrostidew. The Arundinacea’ consist entirely of
genera formed out of the Linnean Arunda. The Chloridew are, perhaps, not
very closely allied, at. least there seems little affinity between Czsnodon and Spar-
timz except in the inflorescence. Koelvria among the Festueaceoe trenches very
