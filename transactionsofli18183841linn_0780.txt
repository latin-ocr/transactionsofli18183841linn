misunderstood by others, who have imagined that the broad umbilicus is di-
rected towards the apex of the fruit *ἢ

In Apodytes', and (as far as Ι can ascertain from uni-ipe fruit or descriptions)
in Pogopetalam, Icacina and Gmnplzandra, where the placenta is combined
with the side of the fruit, the seed is pendulous from near the top of the cell,
and the radiele is consequently next the hilum.

The most important of the above variations of character may be condensed
in the following synoptical view of the order.

* De Candolle (Prodr. i. p. 531) says, ‘⁴ Semen pendulum, basi umbilicatum;'’ Lindley(I71trod.

without mention. however, of the broad apparent umbilicus, which, rather than the real inconspicuous
umbilicus, appears to me to be alluded to by DeCandolle. Endlicher (Gen. Pl. p. 1041) enters into
more detail: “ Semen inversum . . . ,umbilico basilari apicem fructus respiciente, ope rhapheos filifor-
niis, interdum obsoletae, cum chalaza apiani, basim carpicam spectante, conjunct0;‘’ a description
which only agrees with what I have above described, on the supposition that he speaks of the phy-
siological but inconspicuous umbilicus and rhaphe, and not of the remains of thc placenta, which
assume so much the appearance osan umbilicus and rhaphe. In Wight’s Illustrations (t. 40) the fig.
9. referred to in the explanation as a bad representation of the seed “cut lengthwise to show the
whole length of the embryo,” gives a tolerably fair idea of the outside of the seed with the trace of
the placenta.
