450 sslr. SMlTH's Observations (m the Cause of Ergot.

as it has the smell of sugar and water, it occurred to 1ne that the object of
the fly's visits was to seed on this liquid. Ι collected part of this fluid in
a phial‚ and on exainining it in the microscope I found it entirely eomposed
of myriads of generally uniforni oblong transparent bodies, like sporidia of
a fungus, slightly bent, with one indistinet spot near each end; these spo-
ridia-like bodies freely dispersed on diluting the viseid fluid with water, but
retained their forms: I at the moment considered then] to be the sporidia of
the ergot, and Ι was led the inore to believe so, as on applying a drop of water
to a full-grown ergot, multitudes of then] became disengaged froin its surfaee,
and fron] the eraeks or longitudinal fissures, which generally characterize the
ergot‚ the water so impregnated having a inilky appearance.

Ialso found thc sanie bodies on the glumes and other parm, with which
the liquid, having run, had coine in contact‚ and which, when hardened
by evaporation, gave the parts a dark appearance.

On further exarnination I found the sainc bodies on ergots of all sizes, even
on the youngest‚ and on opening yet unexpanded florets towards the apex of
ergot-bearing spikes‚ I frequently detected them on the sursaee of different
parts of the fructification‚ especially on the anthers and ovariuni, and in little
clusters on the hairs and feathery stignias. Many florets, however, were (le-
stitute of thern.

Now as these bodies have been found to aeconipany the ergot through all
its stages, andare present before the impregnation of the ovar-iuni, at least be-
fore the discharge of the pollen, and, consequently‚ before there is any appear-
ance of an crgot being about to be formed, they cannot be its seeds, but no
doubt are in sonie way the priinary cause of it; and it now reinains to deter-
mine what these sporidia-like bodies are. On examining an ergot of Elymas
(or of any other grass) before it has been uioistened, its surfaee is seen to have
a ehalky or dirty white eolour), which vicwed in the niicroscope is seen like a
thin erust having a pruinose snowy appearance, and readily separating on the
least application of moistnre into myriads of the sporidia-like bodies: on view-
ing this erust in a dry state, the pruinose appearance is seen to be caused by
these bodies being joined together lengthways into slightly elevated spicula,

and thus forming a crust.
On extending this examination to the authers, where they appear to 1ne first
