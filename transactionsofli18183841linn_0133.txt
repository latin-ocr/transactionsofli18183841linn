rather opake and minutely gramilate-st1·iate; the fruit of the trigynous
flowers is probably 3—gonal‚ but none of such occurs on our speciinens.

This species may be distinguished from its near ally P. rivipararn, by its
fruit, the length of its filaments, and by the density of the seed-bearing part
of its spike. In that plant the fruit is 3-qnetr011S, and its faces are ovate-
lanceolate‚ smooth and shining‚ the filaments are twice as long as the calyx,
and the whole spike is lax, slender, and elongated„

infimis quam superioribus saepe longioribus acute acuminatis pedicellis
superantibus, staminibus calycem aequaiitib11S‚ stylo profunde tripartita

Stem simple, striated‚ smooth, a foot or inore in height. Lecwes lanceolate,
the apex itself obtuse, the margins reflexed and marked with false crenu-
lations‚ as in P. bulbg‘fermn, the under side often slightly (lowny, the lower
leaves upon long stahzs, the upper ones sessile and narrower. Stipules
long, cylindrical⁷ splitting on one side above, the apex rounded and
slightly acute. Flowers larger than those of P. virilium-um, upon rather
long stalks jointed just below the flower, red, in a dense compact spike
which is not gemmiferous3 the. flowers 5-f1d, their segments obtuse,
stamens 8, about as long or rather longer than the calyx; style divided
into three parm, but scarcely to its base, and shorter than the calyX,
the bracteae ovate, and shorter than the pedicels ; some of the lower ones
often having a long acute point by which they are made to exeeed thr¹
pedioels. Fruit 3-gonous, smooth, shining; in a very young state in our

specimens.
