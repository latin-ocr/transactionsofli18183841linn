tremities, and are more elongated, forming the first of the candal series of
vascular arches already described.

The pelvic arch is represented hy a single piece of cartilage of a erucial form *ς
the transverse pieces curve slightly upwards‚ and we may suppose them to re-
present the iliae elements of the os innominatum: the articular surface for the
basis of the posterior extremity is near the anterior part of the cartilage. This
support of the rudimental ventral lin consists of a single-jointcd sot‘t ray†, si-
milar to that of the anterior extremity‚ but thicker3 about forty joints may be

eounted in this ray, in many of the lai-ger ot' which there were ossifie deposits.

In reviewing the principal characters above notieed of the skeleton of the
Lepiclosiren‚ we obtain good evidence of its ichthyie nature. If, indeed> the
species had been known only by its skeleton, no one could have hesitated in
referring it to the class of Fishes3 hut in that class it would have offered a
most singular and interesting combination of the cartilaginous and osseous
types.

The central elements of the vertebra! colurum—the basis of the six-elmon,—
exhihit a persistenee of its primitive embryonic condition, such as has hitherto
been witnessed only in the Sturgeon and Cyclostomous fishes: hut the supe-
rior arehes and the spinous appendages, instead of retaining the eartilaginons
state, are convertet] into the tough clastic fibrous texture characteristic of the
skeleton of fishes. The cranium in like manner presents an extremely novel
eombination of the cartilaginous and bony states both as regards its partial
ossifieation and the condition of the ossified parts. lt is only in the higher
cartilaginous fishes, eg„ that the maxillary, palatine and pterygoid bones are
blended together to form the simple superior dentigerous arch or upper jaw.
The composition of the lower jaw corresponds with that which characterises
most of the osseous tishes‚ and is more simple than in the Amphihia. The
confluence of the eranial vertebrae reminds one of the condition of the skull in
the Siren: but no vestigo osa preopereular bone is present. in any of the Peren-
nihranchiates. The “ sphenoideum hasilare'' as it exists in the Sturgeon is here
seen in its fully ossitied state. As the basis of the vertebral column presents a
condition analogous to that which charaeterises the early embryonic periods 01'
