Mr. SCHOMBURGK'S Description ‘f the Mora 'free 209

never inspected 1110 flowers of that 1100, 111 110 would have found that, though
resembling some of 1110 Jlimosew, it forms one 1111110 cam-iem of De Candolle.
The absence of authentic references prevents me from 11050111111131 11; 11111 Ι
hope that this want will be supplied by a more competent botanist before 11115

account is laid before 1110 Linnean society.

 

Additiomzl Obvcrz-ufft'ons by GEORGE EENTHAM, Esq. F.L.S.

Fumi the specimens transmittet! by Mr. Schoinburgk, it appears that the
Mora forms a new genus belonging to the order Legnminosw, and to 1111· tribe
(iuss—iem of De Candolle. Its nearest 0111011105 010 with Tar-lligalia of Aublet‚
and Leptololtium of Vogel *ss ; but it differs from both 111 1110 woody texture ofthe
pod, which 15, 1110100101, naturally dehiscent, in the greater regularity of the
floral 110115, 111111 111 1110 sterility of 1110 0110111010 stamina.

The Mora belongs to the series of genera which, as observcd by Vogel,
connect the Soplzoreoe with tho Cass-lew, a circumstance to which Ι also ad-
verted in my memoli-‚inserted 111 1110 Vienna Annals†. Mr, Vogel gives to the
group the 0111110 of Sehipitww, 01111 0005111015 11 05 0 50011011 of the Cast—iem or
cans-alpinae. He 11115, however, correctly shown that the 1111001100 of the radicle
cannot be made 1150 of as aa absolute character to separate the Α*1111111111οω0-11111
the Cassiae, and the only remaining distinction lies in the papilionaceous 00-
rolla of the former: and this arrangement 15 certainly more 1115111101 111 Boze-

one of Mora, 15 gradual3 but it appears to me that the 11110 of distinction
would be much more naturally drawn between Bowdicleia. Ormosiu, 111111 Di-

* At the time Vogel 11111111511011 this genus in the Linnaea (vol. xi. p. 388.),1ny memoir on some genera
of Lessitmizzosoe in the. Annals of the Vienna Muscam was already in p1·int; and 1 111111 there established

a genus of Plzaseoleoe under the samc name : but 115 Mr. Vogel's 11111101 11115 1110 priority os publication,
