A very remarkable Lucanus, obtained at Fernando Po by the gallant Cap-
tain Downes, and named after him in the Zoological 'l‘1·ansaeti‹›11s, has all its
tibiae spineless. In Lucanus Fora-teri the posterior tibiae are unarmed, whilst
the intermediate have one toothlike spine. In my Lucanas Jmllidipennis and
in the L. castaneus of the French cabinets the four posterior tibiae are unarmed.
[n anamzs Περιήρης-’ἵκῃ Speneii, bulbos-us and (astacoidr‘s- (inseets all dill'ering·
considerably in form), the four posterior tibiae are unidentate: and various
other instances of the presence or absence of spines might be added: but
as 1 think, in the instances above quoted, sufficient proof has been adduced
of the variableness of tibial armature, a characteristic hitherto almost en-
tirely neglected by entomologists, Ι pass on at present, hoping to enter
more fully on these points when Ι publish my synopsis of the speeies of Lu-
sannidea.

It only remains to be added, that tropical India appears to be the metro-
polis of the Luranidw, more than fifty species from those regions having fallen
under my inspection. The damage arising from the Stag-beetles even in
Europe is often very considerable, as they perforate the solid wood in all
directions, and in the East Indies the destruction occasioned by them must
be much grezitcr3 but I am not aware of any instances on record of the injnry
there sustained from their attacks. The increase of species in the East is great,
and the number of individuals of each speeies is ostentimes very surprising.
It may here also be remarked, that the armature of most of the Indian spe-
cies is strongly developed, and there ean be little doubt that, as they are thus
amply provided, it was wisely intended for the performance of those functionis
which are allotted to them3 one of which, perhaps, is to keep in check the
exuberant luxuriance of tropical vegetation. The Lucani of an Indian forest
may be called the pioneers of its destruction: the rains during the mon-
soon enter the holes and excavations which they have made in the teak and
other hard woods, and soon produce decay in the beart of the tree, when the
white ants and other insen-ts follow in their track‚ so that in a short time the
pronde-st trees in the forest crnmblc into (lust and disappear. lt may here be
added, before concluding these remarks, that the larvae of the Stag-beetles are
supposed by some authors, under the name of Cossus, to have atl'orded a de-
lieious repast to the Roman epicure: and it seems not improbable that this
