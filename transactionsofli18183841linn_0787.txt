Mr. BENTHAM'S Account qftwo new Genera allied to Olacinefe. (583

talum. Yet the imbricate aestivation of the corolla, the stainens often iude—
finite, the structure of the ovary, δια, will remove them at least as far from
Olacineoe as Hamil-iucem

Cornece, and some other allied albuminous orders, have also some. resem-
blance to machmam but the essentially and completely adnatc ovarium, the
epigynous disc, the ovules suspended from the apex of the cells, eto, remove
them much farther than the two last-mentioned orders.

In the second tribe of Olacinew, the Opilieoe, where the. calyx is reduced to
little more than a dilatation of the torus, we have the nearest approach to the
Semtalacecm and, if it be admitted that there are true Santalaceous genera
with a superior ovary, and if Ι am right in supposing that in the young bud
of Opilio and Can-§jera there is inore than one ovulc, then these two genera
become so nearly intermediate between Olaceoe and *S'antalacew as to have
nearly as much claim to be associated with the latter as with the former. In-
deed it appears to me, from dried specimens‚ that the structure of the ovule
in Opilieoe, very different from that of (Πυθίη), is very similar to that of The-
sium. Thus, whilst a considerable gap is observable between Olacineoe and
the nearest allied of the Dichlamydeous orders with which they have been
compared, the close connexion with Santalaceoe is completely established
through the Australian species of Olaoe and the Opilieoe.

The third tribe, the Icacineoe, intimately connected with the two preceding
ones in most lespects, recede from them in some remarkable points, espe-
cially in the adherence of the placenta to one angle of the ovarium, and the
seed, which is consequently pendamus, not ercet. Ι should therefore. have
proposed them as a separate order, were it not for the remarkable resem-
blance to some true Olacineous genera in the arrangement of the floral parts,
without any distinctive character of importance, other than the one above
mentioned.

I now add the detailed characters of the two new genera figured :—
