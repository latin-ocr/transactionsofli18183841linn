XXXVII. On Cuseuta epilinum and halophyta. By CHARLES C. mammos,
Esq„ MA„ F.L.S.‚ F.G.S.‚ ἅμ.

Read November 5th, 1839.

IN a paper which the Society has done me the honour to publish in the
second part of the present volume of its '1¹1·ansactions, Ι have added my testi-
mony to the existence of scales in the tube of the corolla of C. eumpse«, as first
stated by M1·.Brown‚ and endeavoured to explain by their extreme difficulty of
detection, even in living speeimcns, the faet oftheir not. having been observed by
several botanists of eminenee. Since the publication of that paper Ι have ob-
tained specimens of two other species, in both of which l have found these little
orgalls, and will, with the permission of the Society, proeeed to lay before it an
account of the appearances presented upon an internal view of their corollas.

In the first of these planus, C. epilinum, W‘effie, we find a ventricose tube
furnished with a whorl of adpressed bifid scales, each braneh of which is
usually divided in a rather irregular manner into two or three fingerlike
points, as Ι have endeavoured roughly to represent in fig. l.; the divisions of
the corolla terminate in acute points, and the stamens have very short fila-
ments and are inserted niueh higher up than the extremity of the scales.

In Reiehenbaeh's figure of this plant in his Irones Plant. tab. 693, the scales
are very incorrectly given, each of them being there represented as two
minute, separate, roundish bodies, pointing (lownwards. Specimens received
from him (No. 19 of his Fl. Germ. fluvia), gathered near Boma, in the neigh—
bourhood of Chemnit2‚ by M. lVeieker, have however these parts of exaetly
the form described above, and agree in all points with the English plant, with
the exception of the want of a bractea under each bunch of flowers. It is
however possible, from the manner in which this bractea is hidden by the
flowers in the English plant, that it may also exist in that found in Gernlany,
although the employment of its absence as a part of the specific character is
strongly opposed to this supposition. Iam indebted to my friend Mr. J. Ε.
