grasses. Later still, Kunth in his valuable work on the Graminew has ar-
ranged all these with Triticum, while the annual small—seeded Trition, which
had been united by some authors to Rraclzlzspodimn, are referred by him to
Festum. He. has also referred to Festum the ,S'clerm—hloa of P. de Beauvois,
501110 of which are plants which Smith had separated from Poa to add to Gly-
ceria, and he leaves to the latter genus only two European speeies, (ifluitans
and G. aquatica, plants not in habit closely allied, yet certainly very similar
in the structure of their florets.

The number of genera of grasses described by Kunth is 235, embraeing
3034 speeies. No one 0011 have all these at once present to the mind, and it
therefore becomes necessary to adopt some method which may bring them
before us 111 regular succession or 111 tribes. Linmeus founded his primary
divisions on the number of florets 111 0 common calyx, and their arrangement
in 0 scattered manner, or 111 0 regular spike, making some exceptions‚ and
adding 111 0110 01· two 11151011005 some other character, in order to avoid any
violent opposition to nature. IIis system obliged him to disperse some genera
into different classes ; but 111 111050 included in the class and order Triandria
Digynia he 1105 endeavoured, in number-ing the genera, to show something of
their natural affinities in a consecutive series. In the English Flora, where
the genera are less numerous, it appears of less consequence to make a corn-
plete arrangement; but Sir J. E. Smith has followed the example of Linnaeus
in 0 double distribution, arranging the genera 01 first according 10 0 definite
character, and when he comes to the 51100105, placing them in 011 order more
nearly corresponding with their natural affinities. No art, however, can
reduce the genera of grasses into a simple natural 501105. The Linnean bo-
tanists of the continent of the present day do not seem in general 10 trouble
themselves with this double order, but are eontented to number and place
the genera as they are distributed by the artificial character, and in this they
have been followed by Dr. Hooker. Palisot de Beauvois, observing the de·-
feets of all former arrangeinents, published in 1812 an “Est-ai (l'zme lVozc-
velle Agrostographis2.’' In this 110 divides the grasses into two great fannlies‚
in 1110 first of which the spieulae or locustae are all alike, each containing
either perfect florets, or 1101015 which unitedly 00111010 011 1110 110115 necessary
for the reproduction of the plant. The second contains those plants where
