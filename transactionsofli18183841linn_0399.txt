imperfect divisions corresponding in number with the upper and lower spines.
The neurapophyses‚ 01· laminae protecting the spinal choi-d, are ossified. as
are also the neural spines and the haemapophyscs and haemal spines* in the
candal region.

The nenrapophyses of the atlas are slightly expanded at their lower extre-
naues, and almost meet below the foramen magnum, where they rest upon the
anterior pointed extremity of the gelatinous chord ς as they ascend, they are
hent at an open angle, with the upper ends meeting above the foramen inag-
num: these extremities are disunited‚ and a short spine is attached to them
hya ligament. The neurapophyses of the second cervical vertebrae have their
bases expanded so as to meet below the spinal marrow and above the gela-
tinous chord; they are disnnited above, as are the rest of the 11e1n·apophyses†.
The basis of these vertebra] elements, besides being developed inwards, are
expanded in the antero-posterior direction so as almost to touch each other;
they become gradually narrower as they approach the candal region. The
neural spines‡ increase in length from the atlas to the fourth vertebra, and
are continued of the same length, viz, between four and five lines, to the
middle of the candal region, whence they progressively diminish to the end of
the vertebral column. The supernumerary or dei-mal spineng are rather shorter
than the true vertebral spinos, to the upper end of which they are attached hy
ligmnents, as in other fishes. In the candal region they are expanded and
compoessed, and give attachment to the horny transparent filaments which
support the membrane of the candal fin: the inferior corresponding ap-
pendages Η of the haemal spinesffl present a similar form, and, like the upper
ones, have the same hony structure and green colour as the ossified parts of
the true endo-skeleton. The liaeilial)01)liyses** are relatively longer and more
slender than the neurapophyses.

The capsule of the anterior extremity of the gelatinous chord is ossified at
its inferior and lateral parts, where it forms the base of the cranium3 and the
bodies of the occipital and posterior and anterior sphenoidal vertebrae are
represented by a single elongated sub-triangular plate of bone††. The base
