⁴172 Jlr. E. J. QUEKETT on the Ergot «f Rye.

There is a point which, as regards the medicinal properties of the crgot of rye,
is deserving of being mentioned in this place, froin having found in munerous
instanccs that the spec-iniens obtained from various grasses have frequently
been not much 1nore than hollow cases, instead of being solid. On looking
for the cause, it was found that this excavation had been effected by numbers
of a small species of Avarus (Tab. XXXIII. B. fig. 12), which had devoured
the interi0r3 co1iseqiie11tly, if the medicinal virtues reside in that part, which
however is disputed‚ the specimens must become inert. The destruction that.
these tiny creatures make will become apparent by the following statement
obtained from a friend, viz.: that from six pounds of ergot of rye, kept six
months in the sanic paper, six ounces of powdery excrementitious matter was
obtaincdz therefore the practice of keeping camphor with the ergot is likely to

prevent the attacks of these minute depredators.

 

EXPLANATION OF TAB. XXXIII. B.

Fig. l. Represcnts a transverse section (erfrenzely thiu) of the body of the
crgot‚ magnified seven hundred tinics, exhibiting irregular-shaped
cells, containing grannlcs of various sizcs5 and the purple cnvelope,
with some inenibranous portion adhering, probably remains of peri-
carp.

2. A longitudinal section of the sanic, showing also the granules contained
in thc cells, the latter appearing to bc ‹lisposecl in sornewhat regular
roWS.

3. Shows different. kinds of sporidia, which contain granules of various
numbers, the first having none.

4. Represents their germination by einitting tubes which contain granules
similar to those in the interior of the sporidiunn from which they
arise.

5. Is the manner of germinatimi, by giving off minute buds, Which ulti-
mately become sporidia, four, five, or more, adher-ing occasionally
together, and finally separating.
