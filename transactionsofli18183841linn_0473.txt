*S'pongillafluviatilis, when kept even in fresh water, ancl to increase in length.
This latter fact I consider as the better aecounting for the presence of those
filaments; and Ι 011101111111 111 my own mind little, if any, doubt that the fila-
11101115 of the θορήν-(ἀ (01· Osrillatoria probably) which Ι have 50 repeatedly
examined under the 111101050000, and 50011 attached so often to that 5000ςο,
are in reality the “ 11111111οη5 flagelliformes'' spoken of by Dujardin, and that
the 1110110115 of that Conferat or Oscllluloria in the liquid, easily and most na-
turally explain the cause of ‘⁶ 105 111111110115 agites sur le 001110111- 110 0011111115

more “analogues aux Amiltes,“'——wl1ich Amoebw, Ehrenberg tells 115, 1110 01·-

similar portions of many of the gelatinous structures of the Algae, or even of
certain kinds of the Femgi.

Moreover, it is 010111 111111 110 good argument in support of the animality of
the Spongilloe 01111 110 brought forward from their smell; for I have found this,
when the specimen is quite fresh and immersed in pure water, to be rather
pleasant than otherwise, but on the deeay of the gelatinous portion it 001·-
