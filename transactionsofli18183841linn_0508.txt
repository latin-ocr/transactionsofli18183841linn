cell, forming a hollow tube, in which in the dricd state there appears to be
more or less of congealed matter, probably fluid when fresh. These seereting
hairs are somewhat conical in Heliamplzmu, very long and slender, but with
the same structure in Sarracenia purpurea.

Notwithstanding several memoirs which have been already published on
the δ’(ιι-ιγιυσηὶιυ, it. does not appear that any course of observation and experi-
ment. on the living plant has ever been closely and carefully followed up with
a view to ascertaining the precise nature and functions of the abovementioned
very distinct μοι-110115 of these singular pite-hers. They are constantly observed
with more or less of an aqueous fluid in them, which is generally supposed to
he chiefly, if not entirely, water derived from rains and dews‚ a circumstance
not at all horne out by the structure as it appears in the dried state. The lower
portion is evidently contrived to produce copious secretions ; 1110 central appa-
rently smooth portion, often covered with an infinity of minute glands, appears
destined to 501110 important function in the economy of the leaf, and the form
of the opening appears but ill contrived for the mere purpose of collecting
rains and dews. One effect of the singular clothing of the orifice is known to
be the retaining such insects as may venture within it, and some have even
gone so far as, on that account, to consider these plants as carnivorous; but
surely, if killing the insects were the main object of this apparatus, it would
meet with better success than the imprisoning some half a dozen flies or beetles
during the whole season the leaf lasts. It were therefore much to be wished,
that American botanists‚ who have opportunities of observing these plants
under those circumstances which are natural to them, would carefully ascer-
tain the state of the different parts of the pitcher‚ the nature and amount of
any secretions, and any other phenomena that may take place at different
times of the day and of the season‚ at various ages of the plant, and under
various states of the atmosphere, which alone can enable us to found any con-
jectures on its physiological functions.

The scape of Ileliamplmra‚ instead of being one-flowered, as in Sam-acenim
hears a 10050 raceme of from two to six nodding flowers, horne on short pedi-
0015, each pedicel springing from the axilla of a concave bract, similar in ve-
nation to the piteher part of the leaves. There is no trace of any bracteolae
011 1110 pedicel.
