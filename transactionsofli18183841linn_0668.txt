water, they are found to consist exclusively of the lesser granules, the larger
ones having now altogether disappeared. As the spore swells, the divisions of
the integument are tOrced asunder; a portion at each end however generally
adheres longer, and presel-ves the form represented at ΤΑΒ. XXXIX. fig. 10.;
and although further separated, these divisions are still held in their spii-al
position until the ripening of the spere, when, being ejected from the theca,
they recoil with a jerk, and immediately twist into narrow clavate filaments,
the state in which they have been most frequently observed. TAB. XXXIX.
fig. 12. represents the spore previous to its ripening and to the opening of the
theea3 the filaments are partly umelled, and their attachment to the spore
and to each other is shown.

In the ripened state the spore has a wrinkled or plaited appearance, arising
from some peculiarity iu its immediate covering, which appears to add greatly
to its opacity. On the application of water to the spore⁷ it immediately swells
to eonsiderably beyond its original size, the wrinkles on its surfaee disappcar,
and it changes to a bright green colour. By adding tinctnre of iodine to
the water a very curious effect is produced, which proves the existence of an
outer and inner membrane or tunic to the spore: its nucleus is contracted
to a rnuch smaller size, leaving the outer membrane oeenpying the space to
which it had been distended by the water, and appearing under transmitted
light like a transparent limb to the opake spore (mn. XXXIX. fig. 13.). The
spore 011 arriviug at maturity acquires a dark green colom-2 it contains a thick
viscid fluid, copiously mixed with minute granules exa‹·tly similar to those
contained in the pollen-grains of flowering plants3 they seem not to differ
greatly from, if they are not identical with, the lesser granules found in the
integument and in the intercellular cavities of the theca. The larger granules
having all disappeared immediately after the separation of the integument, it
would appear that their functions are somewhat different from those of the
lesser ones: the former, I have no doubt, are of an amylaeeous nature, being
soluble in boiling water, but not in alcohol. Ι inclosed some spikes of Equi-
setum hyemale, in that state when the granules of both kinds are most nume-
rous, in a phial with water; the phial was then held in a vessel of boiling
water for half an bour, and on examining the theca*⁷ I found that the larger
granules had all disappeared, but that the lesser ones remained unaltered,
