prevents a positive assertiou upon this point*. The variations, however, ex-
isting between these two groups in the important organs noticed above is so
great, that, in comparison with the structure of other allied tribes, it must be
admitted that we here find the real characteristies of an analogy‚ namely, ex-
ternal similarity of form, but a complete diversity of structure in the essential
organs.

The exaniples hitherto produced have exhibited analogies existing between
insects belonging to the same order. In this latter respect, however, (or, in
other words, on account of their Coleopterous sti-ueture,) they are related
together by affinity.

Of the still more widely extended relatiouship resulting from analogy‚ many
examples might be given. Some have already been noticed in the introductory
remarks upon the genus DJ‘JPSI'S2 published in the last volume of the Trans-
actions of this Society. Others may be mentioned wherein a great enlargement
either of the scutellum or the posterior part of the prothorax is observed,
which, contrary to the ordinary structure, is extended entirely over the body
and wings. The genus *S'cutellera (so named from this circumstance) aniongst
the Heteropterous IIemiplera, many Centruti, ἃς. amongst the Ilomopterous
Hemiptera, the species of Aer-zflliam (Tem-tir, Latr.) in the order Ortlmptera,
Tlmrocsmtlm, Latr.‚ in the Ιζιμηρηομΐθνα, aud Cehspllzm, Dalm. in the DIptera‚
—respeetively exhibit this singularity of formation.

The eurious genus Colman, Thunberg (Hollzgflnenia, Serv, and st. Farg.)‚ is
strikingly represented amongst Dipterous inseets by the insect which I have
ligured in Grilliths's “Animal Kingdom ” under the name of Diateina Hollzgsme-
umidae, and in which the structure of the antennae, and even the white colour
of the terminal joints‚ are especially traceable in a most singular manner.

The Neuropterous genus Ascalaphus in like manner analogically represents
the genus Papilio in another Order‚ Lepicloptera. But the most complete
instance which Ι have hitherto met with, of deception produced by an insect
of one order assuming the appearance of another, occurs in the species about

²¹* RS. The recent discovery by Dr. Ratzeburg of the larva of Bostrichus capucinus fully eonfirms my
supposition, it being hexap0d‚ whilst that of the Scolylidae is apod. Thus whilst the antennae, trophi,
tarsi and lai-vac of Rhyzopertha and Tomicus are totally distinct, their general form and habits are simi-

lar. thus establishing their relation as one merely of analogy
