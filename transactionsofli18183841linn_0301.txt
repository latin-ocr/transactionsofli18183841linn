Mr. VALENTINE οη the existence (gf Stoinata in Jlasses. 243

hiscence is preventcd from falling on account of its adhcsion with the eolu-
mella (a common occurrence), which may be a sufficient provision against the
premature (lispcrsion of the sporules3 or even the 1155110 111 501110 cases may be
so lax 111 its disposition as to allow of the aetion of the atmospherc on the
internal organs: and Ι 11111 disposed to believe that this takes place to a eon-
siderable extent, from witnessing the presence of green granules in tissue
which appeared to have no communication whatever with the air, and from
being frequently puzzled to decide whether certain double lines on thc euticie,
formed by thc walls of two neighbouring cells, are stomata 01· not; they ccr-
tainly often appear as competent to perform the imputed funetion of stomata
as the stomata themselves. Although the cause of the green colour of the
granules is light, Ι think I am right 111 giving the atmosphere a share in the
process, for from what other source is the carbon on which the light acts de-
rived? In addition, the theca of Phasi-um alterng'fblimn is thinner and more
transparent than that of any other 111055, and it is well known that the 1155110
of mosses is of all other plants the most easily permeable by water, the per-
meability being in fact 50 perfect as to make the presence of stomata 115
exhalants unnecessary ; and, finally, stomata are not found 111 11 single instance
on the organs of vegetation. So much for what is as yet but a conjecture. You
will observe that I have assumed the hardening to be caused by the influence
of the atmosphere.

The development of the stomata will be an interesting subject for investi-
gation: all I at present know of the matter 15, that in the young state they
are very small and much less numerous than when the theca has arrived at
maturity3 for instance, the average number on the theca of Ortltotriclzwn dia-
phanum, when mature, 15 from twenty to five and twenty, whilst on the very
young theca Ι have found as few as five, and these were like ordinary stomata,
the projecting cells in that early stage not having been developed.

I have some hope that I shall be able to turn these stomata to good ac-
count in the arrangement of genera. If 1 succeed, you shall have the facts 111
11 future letter. Ι have not yet actually begun my work. Ι am collecting
material which grows almost daily. I shall soon begin a series of drawings
illustr-ating the development of some common moss in all the stages of 115
