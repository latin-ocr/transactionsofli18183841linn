[Ur. VVEs'rwoon on the Family Fulgoridae. 137

Forehead with elevatcd central carinze . . . . Plzenair.
(Eumullia, Guer.)
b. Front of the head rostrated . . . . . . . . Fulgore.

The last—named genus is thus made to comprise not only the old species
F. Laterum-ia, Candelaria, and their allies, but also F. recurva, tuba, and taber-
culum, together with Flam liwmoptera of Perty3 111 which last two species the
head cannot be said to be rostrated, and in the first two the rostruni is sinall
and recuwed, and the second joint of the antennae oval, whence they ought
not to be separated from i-Iplmmt discolor,fuscata, &c.; although from the
general habit of the insects, and even the colouring of the wings, F. re-
rurra and its allies as well as F. Jdatyrltimc are perhaps too closely related to
F. diadema to warrant their absolute removal froin the genus. The species.
however, are so closely connected together that it is impossible to draw the
line of distinction. Gerinar has also, in a nienioir upon this tribe of inseets„
published in the fourth number of §ilberniann's ln’crue Entmnolagique‚ sepa-
rated Fulgora curopwa, lrzsnlinstta, seiuncti-ala, ἃς. under the generic 1111111(Ι of
Dictyoplnmt, with the character, ⁴⁵ Elytra apice reticulata, clypeus oblongo-
ovatus‚ caput conico-elevatuni.'' In consequence of this gcneric nanle being
previously employed, D1·.Bur1neister has changed it in the second volume of
his “ Ham‘lhuclts' p. 159, to Psemlapltamz.

As restricted above, the genus Fulgora may be thus characterized:

Corpus oblongum, suhdepressuni. Caput fronte in rostrum vel tubuluin plus
minusve elongatum, porrectum, (nec recurvunnJJ producta3 nec conico-
elevatum. Antemne articulo 211110 globoso, heinisphericQ granuloso, seta
e medio ejus apicis exeunte, articulo minutissimo ad basin setze. Ofelli 2
inter oculos et antennas vel potins paullo ante antennas positi. Pronum-sis
3-articulata‚ ad usque vel ultra basin pedani postieoruin extensa. (Ἰμ-
pens trigonus basi truncatus. Lala-um apice acutuni. Pronum-acas- ‹lor-
sum niesothorace paullo minus, postice subenlarginatuni. Hemelgstra alis
minora, latitudine inulto longiora, apice crebre venosa et reticulata.
