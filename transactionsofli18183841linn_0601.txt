XXXII. A'otice Qfa Plan! which produces perfect Seeds willzout (my apparent
Action qf Pollen. By Mr. JOHN ΞΜΙΊῊ, A.L.S.

Read June Isth, 1839,

ΤΗΕ subject of this notice is a native of Moreton Bay, on the east coast
of New Holland, and its introduction is due to the late Mr. Allan Cunning-
hain, who sent three plauts to this garden in 1829 *ἢ Mr. CunnIngham not
having seen the plant either in flower or fruit, could not determine to what
order it belonged ; bnt fron] its general habit, and from the presence of sffipules,
he described it as a “scrubby Ilex-leaved plant, probably belonging to Urticeoe.”
Cultivation has not altered its habit, for the plants continue to be irregularly
branched, rigid, evei-green shrubs, about three feet high, of a harsh aspect, with
alternate leaves, on a short petiole, which, as well as the young branches, is
covered with short hairs: the leaves are elliptical, marginate, aud furnished
generally on each side with three acute lobes, each of which, as also the apex,
is terminated by a short spine (similar to those of some species of Iler and
Berberis) ; and the stipules are small, subulate, and persistent.

Shortly after their introduction the plants produced female flowers, an ex-
amination of which proved the genus to be EuphorbiaceouS, and allied to
Sapiumt but although Ι have watched them carefully froin year to year, Ι
have been unsuccessful in detecting anything like male flowers or pollen-
bearing organs; and Ι should naturally have passed them over as dioecious,
and considered the three introduced individuals as fernales, had not my
attention been particularly directed to them in consequence of each of thern
producing fruit and perfect seeds, froin which I succeeded in raising young
plants. This, too, was not the result of one year, but of several successive
years’ sowing: the plant now exhibited to the Society was raised last year,

'¹‘ Mr. Brown informs me that he collected specimens of this plant, but equally without fruetifica-

tion, at Keppel Bay, on the same coast, in iso-2.
