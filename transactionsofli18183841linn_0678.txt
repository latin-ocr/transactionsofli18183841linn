⁵78 Rev. M. J. BERKELEY οη α Gall gatlzered in Culta

culum is very singular-*t but on these points I am happy to give an ex-
tract from a letter of Mr. MacLeay‚ Which appears to me extremely 111-
teresting.

‘⁴ Ι have exainined the production of the Ochnaecous leaf under the micro-
scope, and ain convinced with you that it is the work of an insect‚ but I have
not been so successful as you 111 discovering this insect. On obsewiug, how-
ever, thc structure of the nidus, I conceive it to be much more analogous to
that of some of the woody galls than to the cocoons figured by Cui-tis in the
paper to which you have referred in the Zoological Transactions. The first
cocoon figured as that of a Melolontlzidous insect is that of a whole Lepidopte-
rous genus very common in Ainerica and New IIolland. 1 have plenty of
speciincns collected by 1nyself. 'she second figured by Curtis, and which is
so like a gall, is more new to 1110·, but I know several Lepidopterous coeoons
analogous to it which appear to be gaus, 01· rather productions of the tree to
which they are attached, 1 have bred the insects, however⁷ frequently, and
found that the substance of these pseudo-galls is not vcgetable but animal:
that is, the caterpillar coinposes then] of a sort of mason-work of its ex-
crement, coated inside and out. with a varnished silk or silky varnish. Ι
have little doubt that this is the composition of the cocoons figured by Curtis,
but who was not aware of the fact fron] never having had an opportunity of
investigating the 0000110111)Υ of these insects 111 their native country. Cocoons
necessarily have opercula, or at least a place more easy of exit than their
general substance will allow. So has the production 011 the Ochnaceous leaf.
but its structure is vegetable‚ and I ain therefore inclined to consider it a true
gall, although Ι know 110 other instance of a gall with an operculum. The
question then is, whether the larva you found has feet or not; if it has, the
larva is probably chidopterous, which would be very singular. If it has not,
the larva is probably Ifflyinenopterous7 allied to the Diplolepidoe. Upon the
whole I consider it to be a gall most likely made by an Hynienopterous in-

sect.''

* lt is clear that the gall described and figured by Reaumur (Mem. pom· servir ὰ l'Hist. Nat. des
Insectes, tom. iii. p. 448. pl. 39. figg. 1—4), quoted by Mr. curtis 111 Trans. Zool. Soc volt i. p. 307, has
not an operculu1n; for he distinctly says, that before it spins its coeoon it pierces a hole in the gall;
and the figure indeed shows the same tolerably well.
