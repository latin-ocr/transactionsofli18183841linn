ἼξνΙἾΙΕΝ the highly curious and important function performed by the spin-
ning apparatus of spiders is duly considered, it will not appear surprising· that
the attention of zootomists has been repcatedly directed to the organizatiou os
parts exercising so remarkable a degree of intlnencc upon the economy of the
animals to which they belong, and that the powers of the microscope have
‹·‹›nt1·ibuted largely to promote the investigation of this interesting sui›ject;
but, though much has been aceomplished by these resea1·clieS‚ much yet re-
mains to be effected 3 new facts must be elicited and prevailing errors corrected,
before our knowledge of the matter under consideration can bc regarded as
exact.

Having· carefully examined the external anatomy of the spinning mammulae
of various species of spiders5 Ι have been led to form opinions relative to their
number and structure differing essentially in several particulars from those
generally received; and if, in promulgating the views which an accumulation
of evidence too powerful to be resisted has compelled me to adopt, 1 find
myself opposed to zoologists of the highest distinction and authority, it is, as
l have formerly stated on similar occasions, with every sentiment of deference
and respect, and with a perfect consciousness of the many and great disad-
vantages of the position which I occupy, that Ι venture to question the sound-
ness of their doctrines.

All the spiders Which have hitherto come under my ohservation have been
provided with four, six, or eight spinning· mammulae, somewhat conical or
cylindrical in figure, and composed of one or more joints caeli: they are
usually closely grouped in pairs, which may be readily distinguished from
each other by their relative positions. The pair situated nearest to the rmus
