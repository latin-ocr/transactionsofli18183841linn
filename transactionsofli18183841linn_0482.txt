406 [Ur. HOGG’S Observations οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

1 think they really present a stronger affinity with many of the Fungt} par-
ticularly with the inore permanent and porous kinds, several of the Boleti and
Polypnri, for instance3 I therefore propose to classify them as follows.

Or, indeed, if it be thought upon the whole more advisable and inore con-
sistent with the nature of their structures that all the Sponges be included in
the heterogeneous order Algw, they should then compose a distinct and sepa-
rate family, 5))c)›1giaceoe‚ and be placed immediately next to the order Fzmgi.
Notwithstanding that our knowledge respecting the nature of Sponges has
during the last fifteen years received some advanceinent, I must express a
hope to you that observers, whose leisurc and situation on the Sea coast* afford

e The difficulty of preserving Sponges, even in bottles filled with rectified spirit of wine, is so great,
that no one, who has not the means of examining them in a fresh condition and in their native element,
can ever expect to throw much light 011 their variously-formed strnctures. The dried masses of fibrous
skeletons, (levoid of their true natural forms and ecloum, without their parenchymatous jelly and enn
veloping membrane, &Q as exhibited in our museums, can bnt little assist us in obtaining a correct
knowledge of their natural history„
