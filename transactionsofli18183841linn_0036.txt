6. Lappago. Spiculae 011 short. spikes in a raceme. The uppermost tabescent.
Outcr glume filmy3 inner coriaceous, priekly. No abortive floret.

Pas-palma is not a European genus, but it seems necessary to notice it on
account of its close affinity with Digitaria. ‘⁶ A Punico distinct.u1n‚'' says
Kiintli, “nonnisi glum-a inferiore plerumque abortientes Kunth puts Digi-
faria with Panicum. The term plerumque must in such a case be interpreted
as admitting an accidental defect, not as a specific mark 3 that in all species it
usually exists³ but is in some occ-fasionalhs wanting3 for if this be the οηζι]
distinction, it is evident that a species uniformly possessing the inferior glume
must be a Punicum and not a Pasqmlum. In the same way I should explain
the “glanae rarissime 2'' in the generic character of Paspalum. On reverting‚
however, to thc specics, we find that the glumes of this genus are always men-
tioned in the plural. It would certainly he eleaoer, where there is only one
glunic in a spicula, to mention it in the singular3 but supposing this to be
merely a looseness of expression, we can yet, Ι think, hardly understand
“ glumis flosculo longi01·ibus” to apply to a single glume3 and in the descrip-
tions of no less than 48 species of Paspalum, two glumes are explieitly men-
tioned, or at least an inferior glume is mentioned, and the superior, as we
know, is always present. The lower is not even always a very small glume,

since we find in Pars-palum distans and P.inoequir11lre gluma inferiore flos-
culo dimidio breviore,'' and in I’aslmlumfias-vescens, ⁴⁶ glumis scquilongis palea
interiore paulo breviorih11s.” Paspalum. fuscum is described “glumis sub-
a’qualihns ;” P. ligabar and P. [tt-erg's'olium, “glumis aequalil)us.'' Is it that
the author in these cases, aster explaining the structure of the flower in the
generic description in his own words, lias, in carelessly copying preceding
writers, called that a glunic in the account of the specics, which he had pre-
viously explained to he the palca of an inferior abortive floret? This how»
ever is not all, sor the lower glume of the spiked and digitate Panicums (Di-
gitart'aets) is described in different specics as arigim, minuta, minutissima, bre—
pissima, minima, obsoleta, and in Panicum tenuiflorum, obsoletissinm. In
Pan. propinquum the glunic is unit-alvis, and in Pungfflfflsum and Pmnpltoeo-
trir the lower glume is nulla.

Another apparent distinction is offered to us by Kunth in the generic cha-
