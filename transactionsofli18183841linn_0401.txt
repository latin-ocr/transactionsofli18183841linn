IIeter‹)ln·ancl1n.s‚ or to the ossitied temporal fascia in the (Vteloniw. These
elongated post-frontals are of a triangular sorni, their narrow and irregular
base is anterior, and is connected with the median frontal by a iuoveable
ligmueutous joint: a small longitudinal vertieal erest or ridge is given off
from the under surfaee.

The analogue of the eonjoined nasal and intcrmaxillary bones* is a strong
triangular plate of boue, with its rounded anterior apex forming the ante-
rior extreinity of the skuli, and supporting at its under surface the two
long and sharp intermaxillary tecth. It has a slight vertical moventem, by
means of its posterior ligaiuentous connexioms, upon the. frontal and aseend-
ing process of the maxillary bone. The maxillary bones, palatines and ptery-
goids are represented by a single piece of bone on each side. The deutal
portion of this bone presents three vertical ridges, with intervening notehes‚
radiating srom the posterior part of the mesial syinphysis: the ridges are in
the shape of compressed wcdges, with the apex downwards, and are covered
with a continuous dense dental substance with a corresponding cutting cdge:
an ascending triangular process ot' the maxillary risos above the two outer
dental lamina* 3 its apex is directed backwards‚ and isjoined by liganient to the
frontal and interniaxillary bones: the exten-nal angle ofthe maxillary portion
of the bone curves backwards and ends in a free pointl: The pterygoid por-
tion of the bone now described is indicated by its fulfilling the usual funetion
of an abutiuent extendcd between the palatine portion of the upperjaw and
the artieular pedicle of the lower jaw t it is expanded and eompressed as it ex-
tends downwards and outwards to support the inuer sui-face of the articular
pedicle, and teriuinatcs by a broad truncated margin&

The articular surfaee for the lower jaw presents a more eolnplieated form
than is usually observed in either fishes or reptiles: its general eontour pre-
sents a very regular semicircular convexity‚ but the surfaee is sculptured by
two parallel grooves with an intervening conve-x ridge, adapted to a corre-

gous to the rostral prolongation of the anterior part of the cranium in the Sturgeon and other Chondro-
ple›·y9ii; and the true intermaxillaries may be supposed to be confluent with the maxillary, and enter

into the formation of the superior dentigerous arch.
