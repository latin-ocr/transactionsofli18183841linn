which I adopt. IIe does not seem to have found it necessary to assign a
name for the two together. I shall with Linnaeus term it a corolla, but
composed of two palme instead os pctals. This nomenelature seems more
unobjectionable than that of calyx to the outcr eovering3 and if Mr. Brown
has not absolutely proved, he has at least shown it to be highly probable that
these parts are analogous to the outer series of a hexapetalous corolla.

wa. Attached to the outer palea we frequently find an awn, whose presence
nature. and position are often very useful in determining specics, and sometimes
in clun-acterizing genera. Palisot de Beauvois maintains that two organs es-
sentially distinet have been eonfoundcd under this name. To one of them he
applies the name of sum, and describes it as the prolongation of a nerve,
whose base forms part of the substance of the paleae. lt is not necessary that
it should aecompany the paleae, for the whole length of the latter, but may
divide from it in any part. The AWN originates suddenly from the substance
of the palea, and if there should be a nei-ve below, it is much smaller than the
awn, and is considered to be prolonged into a seta embraced by the awn
and adhering closely to it. then broken off, the awn leaves behind no trace
of its existence. Neither Duby nor Kunth seems to aeknowledge. this distinc-
tion. Gaudin adopts it with some modifications. P. de Beauvois has added
to the above characters that the (ιιυη is stt-onger than the seta, and of a firme:-
texture. Gaudin, on the contrary, shows that the (nvn is frequently as fine,
tender and delicate as any seta, as in Aira and Agrestis, which are acknow-
ledged to be awned by P. de Bcauvois himself3 and, on the other hand, in
Triticwn, where both authors are agreed that the terminating point is a seta,
it is firm and thick, so that few awns can cxceed it. He takes, therefore,
principally for his guide its fragility at the point of insertion. P. de Beauvois
assigns a seta to Festum and Braslzgspodium, and an awn to Bromzcs. Gaudin
considers all these genera as setigerous. The nature of the arm may doubt-
less atl'ord sometimes a very useful distinction, but I am afraid it will be
impossible to regat-d it as including two things which ean always be clearly
distinguished. The seta is a mere continuation of the midrib. The amn is
something different or something more3 the peculiarity pointed out by Gau--
din will usually explain its nature.
