supporting· the locustae or spiculae. Other 110111111515, among whom we may
reckon Kanth, apply the term airis 10 1116 stall< supporting the separate 11111615
within the calyx, aud it is 111 11115 latter sense that I have used it.

Locns‘m is the word used by Ray, 111111 adopted by P. 116 Beauvois and hy
Brown for what Linnaeus called spicula, and Sir J. E. Smith a spikelet. Ι feel
the want of a word which may 116 applied with cqual propriety to this part in
the one-flowered ,ξς-1115565 115 well as in the many-tlowered, 11111 am unwilling to
adopt a term already applied to two distinct objects 111 0111111111 history. I
have therefore made use of selcuLA, even when there 15· only one flower.

Gutum. According to Linnteus the calyx of grasses is a glume composed 01‘
two valves. Jussieu also uses the term glunic as expressive of the whole organ.
P. de Beauvois, on the contrary, names the whole tegmen, (01· 111 French, hale)
111111 describes it as consisting of two glulnes. Kunth also 611115 611611 part a
glunic, and Ι follow him 111 11115 115 1116 10051 convenient nomene-lature. As 10
whether or not it should 116 considered as a calyX‚ this must 116 116161111111611 on
1116 general principle of applying that term to the common envelope of a 6001-
pound flower‚ or 600111111ιὲ- 11 merely to a simple one. If we determine upon
the latter, we have ready for us the word involuerun‘n 11111 115 some ‹gi-asses
have another exterior covering, to which we can hardly apply any other terni
1111111 involucrum, Ι have preferred following the tei-minology of Limueus,
which is sanctioned by 61151010, without undertaking to defend its strict pro-
priety. Some 1101001515 have contended that these glumes 1116 abortivo florets,
and there 61111 be no doubt that in some genera abortivo florets do assume
1116 appearance of glumes. In irimpelodesmus 1116 1111161 glunic 15 511111 50106-
times to become a barren floret. Both circumstances tend 10 show the close
affinity of these organs.

PALEA. within the glumes we arrivc attho palere. With Linnacus these
are the mlves of a corolla. This part 15 called stragulum by P. de Beauvcns,
and said to consist of two palese. In the Botam'etm Gallicum the term glumw
is applied 10 1116 011161· coverings, and glzmzellse to the interior, and this also
is the phraseology of Mertens and Koch. Gaudia calls the 011161 envelope a
calyx of two palere, and the 101161· a corolla of two paleolce. Ι think it an
objection to these diminutives that the 1111161 covering 15 very frequently the

largest. Kunth calls these interior valves palere³ and this 15 1116 expression
