Read “Descriptions of some Vegetable Monstrosities.' By the
Rev. W. Hincks‚ F.L.s.

Two of these monstrosities occur in species of Iris. The first is
in a flower of Iri-s versicolor, having 5 outer rcflcxcd segments,
4 inner upright segnoents, 5 stamens, 5 distinct stigmas, and a
5-eelled ovarium. It is evidcnt that this superfluity of parts origin-
ates in the union of two flowcrs: the linc of junction of the flower-
stalks may be distinctly traccd3 and the composition of the ovarium
is equally obvious, three of thc carpels belonging to one flower and
two to the other. ΜΓ. Hincks states that this exactly corresponds
with the case of some monstrous OEnotheroe, in which hc has observed
7 pctals‚ 14 Stamcns, and 7 stigmas, but where no line of junction
of the two flowers of which hc supposes them to be made up is
visible. In all these cases one part of each circle is sacrificed in the
uuion of the two flowem, except in the inncr segments of the Iris,
where one part of each flower is lost. In the second case, ocem-ring
in a flowcr of Iris sambucino, 3 segments of the inner series only
remain, while there are 5 parts in all the other circlos: the line of

junction is much less evident than in the former, but may be observes!

in the ovarium and tube of the pet-ianthimn.

ΜΓ. Hincks compares these cases with monstrosities in his collec-
tion of Narcissus elatior and Salpiglossis strm³1inffl3 in the former of
which two flowers adhcrc, aud are both perfect, the united petals
ancl nectaries separating one from the othcr3 While in the latter
