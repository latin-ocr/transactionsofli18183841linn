to be considered as marginal; and although a confluenee os the two stigmata
of each carpel is the more usual structure, he adduces some cases, of compara-
tively rare occurrence, in which the stigmata of the adjoining carpels are
confluent, as in Parnassia, many Craeffww, and Paptwemeese, as well as in
the majority of Iridew, such cases of deviation being often, according to him,
obviously connected with adaptation of snrfaec to the more complete perform-
ance of functioni-². These views may in like manner be applied to Burnum-
niaeeoe; thus in Didyma-{ega we may conceive that there exists a confluencc„
not only of the ovulit'erous margins of the adjoiuing carpellary leaves, bnt οἵ
the adiacent Stigmata of the several carpels, differing thus from Oreleidew„
where, in cases of their complete development, the stigmata of each carpel are
united and remain distinct from those of the adjoining component part of the
pistillum. The probability of this conclusion is strengthened by the appear-
ance of the lateral lobes of the stigmata of Dietyostega, and by the two horn-
like appendages of those of Apteria, as shown in the figures illustrative ot'
these parts. Although the trilocular Bumzmwiuoeoe will be seen to agree with
those hidem to which Mr. Brown has referred, by having the stigmata alter-
nate with the placentae, they still differ from that order in having their stamens
constantly opposite to the inner segmeuts of the perianthium3 and notwith-
standing the close affinity shown to exist between this family and Orestidem.
we have here, independent of all other considerations, a suffieiently well-de-
fined character in the position of stigmata, to establish a line of complete
distinction between them.
