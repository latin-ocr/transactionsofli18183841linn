compared with the head and the ext1·emitieS‚—a difference which is quite
independent of age or growth; and the character, “pedes valde distantes‚''
which Dr. i latterer has founded on the length of the trunk, must be restricted
as a specific application to the Lepidosiren paradara.

Dr. Natterer obtained two speciincns of his species3 one of these, which
measured upwards of three feet in length, was found in a swamp on the left
bank of the Amazon, above Villa Nuova; the other, which was nearly two
feet long, was taken in a pond near Borba‚ on the river Madeira, a tributary
ot' the Amazon. The specinoen about to be described, though differing appa-
rently from the L. pat-adara only in certain proportionis of its outward form,
is a native of a different continent, and was taken in the river Gambia*.
It is a female, with the ovaria well-developed, and mensures twelve inches,
eight lines in length: its greatest circumferenee is four inches and a half†.
The head commences by an obtuse muzzle, and gradually enlarges in all its
dimensions to the gill-openings, which are situated immediately anterior to
the base of the peetoral extremities: the length of the head from the snout to
the gill-opening is one ineh, eleven lines; the trunk, from the pectoral to the
venti-al filamentary fins, is five inches, five lines. The alillS, οι· rather the
eloacal vent, is a small elliptical aperture marked with radiating lines, which
is situated three lines behind the ventral filaments, and offers the same pecu-
liarity as does that of the Lepidosircn paradoxa in not being situated on the
median plane: in the present specimen it was on the right side of a longitu-
dinal sold of integument which occupied the middle line. The distance from
the vent to the end of the tail is five inches. The trunk gives a wide ellip-
tieal transverse Section ᾗ, and maintains a pretty uniforni size, slightly de-
ereasing in breadth to the ventral filaments. sseyond these the tail becomes
more rapidly compressed, and, after a short distance, diminishes also in verti-
eal dimension, till it ends in a thin point.

A membraneus dorsal fin commences at the distance of four inches from

together with a smaller dried specimen inelosed in indurated clay, baked hard by the sun. Several
species of insects, peculi-ar to the Gambia, or African forms, accompanied these specimens. It is here
described and figured by permission of the Museum Committce of the College.
