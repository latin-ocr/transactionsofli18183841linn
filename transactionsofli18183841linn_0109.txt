the Ouala «gs'Loranthus aml Viscum. >¹7

Fig. 6. Germinatiiig embryo of a Lorantlms, species unknown, the alhmnen

remaining attached and inclosing the cotyledons.
The radicle of the parasite has not yet pierccd the bark of thr

stock.

Fig. 7. Ditto. Removed from its attachments and from the emhryo: the halt
sphaeelated cotyledons are somewhat separated.

Fig. 8. Albumen and cotyledonary end of the same embryo.

Fig. 9. One of the cotyledons and plumula.

Fig. 10. Germination of Lot-anthus rather advanced. The root has at this
period perforated the bark. The rudiments of the second pair of
leaves are visible.

ΤΑΒ. VIII.

Fig. l. Fruit and germinating embryo of Lorantlms *S'curruln cut through lon-
gitudinally. The plumula is just exserted; the radicle has not yet
piei-ced the bark of the stock3 some of the viscum is seen adher-ing
to the fruit. No change has yet taken place in the cotyledon. The
radicle has become whitish in the centre3 the irregular shape οἵ
the sucker-like portion is visible‚ and appears to result from the
small opening in the parietes of the capsule.

Fig. 2. Ditto, considerably more advanced. The albumen has almost entirely
disappeared, and the cotyledon is much shorter.

The root has pierced the harh, the contiguous portions of which
are seen to be sphacelated; and its sucker-like extremity is seen to he
expanded on the snrface of the wood. The first pair of leaves have

> reached to a considerable size3 one, however, is cut away. This i>
viewed obliquely.

Fig.3. More advanced state of a young plant of Lot-anthus scurram) the¹
upper portion of the stein being cut away.

This shows the great irregularity of the base of the axis of the
parasite, the incomplete ring formed round its base in the ligneous
system of the stock, and the latei-al shoot.

Fig.4. A similar young plant more advanced, perhaps of the same specics2
the sphacelated margins of the bark around the base of the parasite²
