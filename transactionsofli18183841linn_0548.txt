some observations were made to discover the method, and it was found that
very many sporidia did not emit tubes or germinate in any way, and evi-
dently cxhibitcd indications of thc membrane which formed thcir parietes
being injurcd and broken down„ thcreby allowing the granules to escape.

These atonis thus sct at liberty, collected, as describch and could be seen
singly, in pairs, or in thrccs; anxious to watch the changes these minute par-
ticlcs would undergo, tlicy were daily examincd for the space of seven or
eight (lays, and it. was obscrvcd that tlicy ultimately appeared to become
bodies like sporidia. During thc first and second day no change was ob-
scrvcd, but after this their margins could not be so well defined by the
microscopc, owing to a minute halo cael] presented: this Ι conceived origi—
nated from a glutinous cxudation around the granulo, which ultimately would
hardcn into incuibranc and become the coat of the new sporidium: in this 1
was not mistakcn, for after some days their size increased, and gradually ap-
peared to approach the condition of other sporidia; those eommeuciug with
two granulcs had thc appearance of two nuclei, those with threc and one
having their respective numbers also.

In this manner has bccn witnessed, by daily examinations, the growth ol*
these Sporidia, which, lwingsbwnl οη the ergo! osorem( grass yet straminea, are
without a doubt connected with the cause of its origin ; the observations point
out thcir various metliods of gcrmination, their advanccment to maturity, and
thcir ultimate production of the mcans of their increasc3 thc little radiate
plant seldom measuring more thau syffith or nal—01¹1 part of an inch in any di-
rection.

From thess: observatious the opportunity has occurred ot' confirming thc
fact, that tliis fungus is capable os existing when separated from the grain, not
requiring that organ exclusively as its matrix, which fact was obscrvcd by
Mr. ›Sinithz the infcrcncc from which must be that thc ergot can no longer
be considered as a pcrfcct fungus² but a dis-cased grain, as chcillc described.
though hc somcwhat crred in the nature of its production. The cxtcrnal ap-
pcarances furnish the same proof‚ as at its apex can bc seen the hairs that
exist on the hcalthy grain, and occasionally also the rcmaius of the stylcs: at
its base is observed thc pcdiccl9 still supporting the two scales, consequcntly
the intermediatc portion is in the position of the body of the grain, and thc
