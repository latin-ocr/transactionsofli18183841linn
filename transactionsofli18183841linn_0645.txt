parted petaloid perianthium. An aphyllous erect stem, with imperfectly de-
veloped leaves, is also a character not uncommon to many terrestrial Orchidew.
Besides this, several instances are now recorded of the full development of three
perfect stamens and three stigmata in orchideous plants. If these considera-
tions alone were held in view, omitting· the very material one of the stamens
and stigmata, it would be difficult to draw a line of distinction between the
structure of these plants and that of Orchideoe3 but the position of the sta-
mens, and other characters, sufficiently remove them apart.

Another analogous fact is deserving of notice: on examining the stigma of
Dictyostega after flowering, it will be found to be crowded with bundles of
white cottony filaments, which may be seen even with a common lens to con·
sist of pollen-tubes issuing in a body from the cells of the anthers and pene-
trating the stigma, leaving their ends exserted, and clavately terminated by
their respective grains, thus displaying in a very beautiful manner the sin-
gular mode of fecundation so ably illustrated by Mr. Brown in his admirable
paper on that subject, published in the lssth volume of the Transactions of this
Society. The pollen also in its texture presents great resemblance to that ot'
the Orchideoe, its component granules cohering in like manner into a solid
waxy mass previous to the dehisccnce of the anthei-s.

The position of the several parts of the flower in Dia-(171).s*t<>gst and the allied
genera will be seen to offer very peculiat- characters, to an examination ot'
which I was led hythe suggestions of Mr. Brown. This profound botanist
was, I think, the first who observed* that the pistilla, when distinct, οι· their
component parts, when united, are generally placed opposite to the petals in
DicotylfflI021eS, while he believed the cells of the trilocular marium, or the
component parts of the unilocular ovat-ium with three parietal placentae in
sshmocotyledones, to be situated uniformly opposite to the (livisions of the outer
series of the perianthiurn3 and in his learned Memoir on Cyrtamlraceoe, lately
published (⁶⁶ Plantae Java11icae‚” p. 110), he has given a very interesting de-
monstration of the structure of the ovat-ium, and the relation which placent&
and stigmata bear to the segments of the perianthium in several different
families.

Mr. Brown considers that in Orchidece the stigmata alternate with the
