402 Jlr. Hoc-(fs Observations on¹ the Spongilla fluviatiliS,

but which, from its having neither polypes nor stellate pores, I consider to he
a species of Sponge and not an Aleqmzium. In this opinion Ellis, Solandervfi
and Montagu† were likewise agreed. Ι 1ν111 therefore bestow the more ap-
propriate name of Spongia Cydonia, or the Quince Sponge, upon this sub-
stance of Donati, of Linmeus, and of Pallas.

Should, however, any future doubt be raised with respect to these seedlike
bodies (sferette) described by Donati, or should it be hereafter attempted to
be shown that the produt-tion itself is strictly an Alcyonimn‚ this would not in
any way invalidate my statement, because the testimony of Dr. Ehrenberg at
all events decides the actual existence of sporidia (Sporangien) in certain Sea
Spongesss, and in all probability they, 115 well as sporules possessing for a
short period the loeomotive faculty observed by Dr. Grant in several others,
will be found at the. proper 50115011 of the year common to, and more or less
abundant 111, every speeies of the Spongia> stlat-ime.

Now 115 10 1110 0111101115 of water: If these do indisputably take place inde-

and uniform manner that. Professor Grant has infor-med us they do in a few of
the 111010 common speeies, that is to say, if the endosniose or entering fluid
