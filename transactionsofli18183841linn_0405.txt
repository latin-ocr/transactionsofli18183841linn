the higher Vertebrata, so also the extremities retain their simple structure as
when they first bud forth, andare devoid of any trace of digital divisions: still
the march of development has begua, and we perceive by the numerous joints
of the cartilaginous ray, that its direction is towards the ichthyic modification
of the great vertebral plan.

Jluscalm· System *ἢ

The muscles of the trunk of the Lepidm-iren present all the simplicity and
uniformity characteristic of the class of Fishes. They are divided by the late-
ral line into a dorsal and ventral series, each series consists of narrow subver-
tical plates of oblique fibres, separated by intermuscular fasciae which afford
on one side attachment to an anterior series, and on the opposite to a poste-
rior series of muscular fibres: these fibres are directed upwards and back-
wards in the dorsal group‚ and downwards and backwards in the venti-al one:
the ventral series occupy the place of the true abdominal muscles which first
begin to be developed in the strictly air-breathing Reptiles. The muscles of
the mandibular, hyoidean‚ branchial and scapular arches are represented in
TAB. XXIII, and will receive their necessary detailed description in thefex-
planation of the figures 111 that plate. The)v resemble in some points the
arrangement of the same muscles 111 the Perennibranchiam, and in other
points that in the true Fishes; but (10 1101 afford any sufficiently characteristic
modifications to merit further notice here. It may be also observed, that
although the muscles of the trunk are quite fish-like in their disposition, yet
that the lower Perenuibranchians and the larvae of the higher Batrachia offer
a similar agreement 111 this part of their organization to the class of Fishes.
