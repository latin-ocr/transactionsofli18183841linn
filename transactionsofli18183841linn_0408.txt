:3422 Prqf. OWEN'S Descriptiam qftlw Lepidosiren annectens.

Beyond these rudiments of a gustatory organ the membrane of the mouth is
smooth, slightly puekered into irregular longitudinal folds, and gradually
contracting as it passes along the interspace of the branchia! openings to the
orifice of the pharynx. This oritiee* is nmch smaller and more suddenly con-
tracted than in Fishes generally, or the Perennibranchiate Reptiles: it is also
defended by a seinieircular valvular fold†‚ which closes it froin below. The
msophagusss is scarcely an inch in length; its lining memhrane is puckered
longitudinally: about three lines from the pharyngeal critice, at the lower
part of the oesophagus, is the laryngeal fissure& or the oritice ot' the ductus
ymenmaticus: the tissure is one line in length, and is pierced in the posterior
part ofa cartilaginous plan-NJ„ which extends forwards to the base of the valve
of the pharyngeal apertnre„ where it terminates in a rouuded edge, a line in
hreadth: this cartilage or rudimenta] thyroid is here obviously subscr-vient to
the maintenanee of the patency of the oesophageal canal anterior to the glottis;
and the remarkable fact of the presence ofa sensitive epiglottis is perhaps ex—
plic-able on the principle of its correlation with the above structure.

The oesophagus gradually expands into a pyriform but not wide stomachffl,
which both in its form and diameter so nearly resembles the intestine that the
liinits between the two are outwardly not very easy to definc. Both ‹Psophagns
and steinach are situated in the same, continuous straight line as the rest of
the alimentary eaual. A slight constriction indicates the pyloric extremity of
the stomaeh. The tunies of the stomach are pretty strong: its lining mem-
brane has a smooth surface, and, in the specimen dissected, it was partly de-
composed, apparently by the action of the gasti-ie juice, which is a common
occurrence in Fishes. The pylorus opens into the intestine by a circular
valvnlar fold of the mucous nmium-anem, the margins ot' which are crenate.

Before describing the rest. of the alimentary canal⁷ a few words may be pre-
mised on the structure ot' the abdominal cavity††. 'l'his commences about
half an inch behind the pectoral tilamentary fins, and extends about half au
ineh beyond the anus. It is separated anteriorly from the pericardiac eavity,

as in Fishcs and Perennibranchiate Reptiles‚ by a distinct transverse septum.
