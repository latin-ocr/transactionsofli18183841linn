also the ease with the scutellum of the embryo of the sound grain.

In fig. 9 is a longitudinal section of an infected grain, more advaneed, being
about eight or ten days after fecundatiom at that period the ergot is eonsi-
derably enlarged, and has already torn and (letached from its base the integu-
ments and cellular substance of the original germen.

After the ergot emerges from its husk, it enlarges very rapidly, ¹and when the
rye is ripe, the ergot is often five or six times the bulk of the sound grain (see
ΤΑΒ. XXXII. fig. ll); and eonsidering that, the ergot is only the enlarged
scutellum, the natural size of which is not quite a tenth part of an 111011, it
must be confessed that the enlargement is prodigious3 but not all the ergots
even in the same ear attain the same size (see Tm. XXXII. fig. lo). The
general number of ergots in an ear is from six to eight, but sometimes there
are even more, and very often there is only oue. single ergot in an ear, the
rest of its eontents being tine sound grains ; but in ears which eontain
many ergots the sound grains are generally small and stunted. As the sub-
stance of the ergot. is very soft at its formation within the young germen, it
generally retains some shape of the original grain7 particularly the groove at
the back.

After the ergot has emerged from the husk, its substance soon indurates‚
and assumes a dark brownish-purple eolour, and gradually becomes very hard‚

ergot appears of the firmness of an almond 01· Ποῖ. lf the ergot is soaked in

sound grain, and if examined through a microscope under water many large
blotches of oil appear to be mixed with it, and when an ergot is lighted at one
end, it burns with a bright flame like a wax candle: this is also the case with
