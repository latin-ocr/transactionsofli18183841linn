Mr. VVooDs οη, the Genera of Europesm Grasses. 27

noticed by other botanists, and which Ι have not been able to find, yet there
is a small callus, which perhaps is peculiar to this grass, whose nature Ι do not

well understand.
PHLfflNEAE.

I separate these from the Phalaridece on the principle explained by Brown,
because they have a tendency to produce an interior instead of an exterior
floret, and also on account of the thinness and delicacy of the paleae. there
no indication of an interior floret is observable, we are content to notice that
there is no symptom of an exterior one, and to judge of the tendency by ana-
logy. There is only one perfect floret in a spicula. The glumes are nearly
equal, and include the paleae. The inflorescence is in a spike-like panicle
tiled all round, and this, perhaps, forms the most marked distinction between
this tribe and the Agr-ostidew, although the paleae in the latter tribe have usually

more consistency. The genera are:

1. Aclmodon. Glumes boat-shaped, nearly equal, three-ribbed, the lateral
ones meeting when closed so as to give the glumes a valvular appear-
ance, and a spindle-like form to the whole spicula.. Paleae 2, nerved,
filmy, unarmed.

2. Plzlezcm. Glumes parallel on the 111idrib, which is prolonged into a seta,
embracing, and forming an oblong spicula3 paleae ⁴2, nerved, filmy or
scariose, unarmed.

3. Alopecmws. Glumes membranous. Palea 1, scariose, awned at the back.

4. Ctypsis. Glumes and paleae membranous, of similar substance and length,
unarmed.

5. Gaea-idiunt. Glumes membranous, including, acute, awnless, ventricose at
the base. Paleae scariose or fihny. The outer truncate3 awn dorsal, or

The boundaries of the two genera PHLEUM and Pmmms have somewhat
shifted their position since the time of Linnaeus. His character of Plzlenm is
“Calyx truncatus, mucronatus.'' That of Smith, “ Cal. of 2 close parallel
pointed valves concealing the corolla of 2 awnless valves.'' Hooker omits the
parallelism of the valves, which, however, is a striking character if understood
