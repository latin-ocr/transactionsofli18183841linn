SECALE seems better separated from Triticum on the small and inefficieut
glumes, and on the tapering form of the outer palea, than on the number of
tlorets.

Ι have not before me a sufficient number of species to affix new limits to
the genera Eunus and Hommum, but I am inclined to find the distinction 'm
the setaceo-aristate glumes, and perhaps in the long awns οι· setae of the latter
genus. The number of florets does not seem to afford a satisfactory line,
since. E. europwus, which is described as two-flowered‚ is certainly more com-
monly met with, as is observed by Sir W. Hooker, having only one, and indeed
Ι have never found in the specimcnsl have examined two perfect florets. The
rudiment of the second is usually a mere stalle aud the whole structure os
the {lower exactly like that of Hordeum pratens-e. E. crinitus llas usually a
distinct palea, perhaps two, to the second floret, but as far as I have seen, it
is always empty. These two speeies, and probably two or three more, not
nativos of Europe, would on my scheme be joined to Ilm-‹lennm but Ι do not
know how far it would be possible to draw a line throughout the genus in ac-

cordance with the habit of the plants.

PAPPOPHOREAE.

'l'his is a very small tribe, containing m the whole only 7 genera, and 2&
species. In Europe we have only l species, which is particularly interesting,
as it cnables our Flora to yield an example of every tribe into which the
(ἐι-ωερε have been divided. The leading characters seem to be the thin and

entire glumes united to coriaceous and many pointed paleae.

Echinuria. Spicula-c sessile„ crowded, placed all round the rachis, 2-——4-flow-
cred, of which not more than the two lower are perfect. Glumes ending
in a seta. Outcr palea with fixe inner with two points. ‚Seed bairless.

These differ from the Hardeacew in having only one perfect floret placed
edgewise on the spike, which is sometimes one-sided, sometimes equal all
round. According to Kunffl, the second imperfect floret, where it occurs,
is in some genera above, and in some below the perfect one. Is this to be
‹cnsidered as an indication that he has united two tribes into one? or that
