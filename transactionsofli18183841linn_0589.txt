have some effect on the sporules of Mosses. From its effects 011 Gymzmstomum rruzzcalalzmz and several

by a thicker grumous viscid tluid, or I believe Ι may say, in other words, that they are particles of
that fluid separated from its more solid constituents, which separation takes place gradually3 and the
