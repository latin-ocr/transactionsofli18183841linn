Mr. BLACKWALL'S Descriptions (gf new Species of Spiders. 603

have been made, and that Ι have had to depend almost entirely on my own
resources, my success in this department of zoology has been greater than I
could have anticipated. Much of this success must be attributed to the cir-
cumstance of having directed my attention more especially to species which.
on account of their diminutive size, require for the accurate investigation of
their internal structure the employment of optical instruments possessing a
high degree of magnifying power.

In taking the dimensions of spiders, it is important that the relative length
of the legs should bc ascertained with accuracy. To facilitate this object, 1
submerge the specimens to be examined in spirit of wine till life is extincta
then removing them to a piece of white card-board, and carefully extending
the limbs with a pin, while they are pliable, Ι take their extent, from the
margin of the cephalo-thorax to their extremity, with a pair of compasses,
which, on being applied to a scale of inehes and parts, gives their measure-
ment.

When exceedingly minute spiders are made the subjects of investigation, it
is essential that the sexual organs should be closely inspected, as they afford,
by their complete development, an infallible criterion that the animals have
attained 1naturity; they also present, by their greatly diversified organization,
particularly as regards the males, in which sex they are connected with the
terminal joint of the palpi, excellent specific characters the value of which
will be duly appreciated when it is recollected that many species so nearly
resemble each other in size and colour as to be distinguished by diflbrences in
structure only.
