tu re, and with the external facet concavet this I regard as the analogue of the
preopercular boness: it gives attachment to thc memhranous and museular
(mter wall of the branchia! eavity in which the (lermal bones of the oper-
culum are developed in ordinary fishes.

A strong cylindrical and almost straight styloz'd bonel· is articulated by a
somewhat compressed and expanded npper extremity to the cartilaginons
petrous clement of the tempora] ; it extends downwards and forwards, parallel
with the os tfflnpanieam, and is articulated to the upper part of the expanded
posterior extremity of the cerato-hyoid boncss. The opposite extremity of the
hyoid is united by ligan‘ient to the corresponding bone of the other side, and
thus completes the hyoidean arch ε there is no representative, bony or cartila-
ginous, of the body of the os lusoides. The slender cartilaginous arches of the
gills are merely attached to and supported by the membrane of the cavity of
the mouth.

The scapulm· or pectoral, like the hyoidean arch, is simply composed of a
pair of elongated incurved bones, representing the anchylosed scapula and
coi·aeoi(l§‚ on each side. The coracoids meet below the pericardium‚ and their
inferior extremities are united by strong ligaments2 the scapular part, as it
bends upwards toward the occipital region of the skull, is expanded‚ coin-
pressed, and concavc towards the interna] and posterior aspects‚ where it
affords origin to the latcral series of museles below the lateral line.

The cartilaginous basis of the rudimental pectoral fin or anterior extremity ll
is articulated to a very regular cartilaginous cavity at the posterior and near
‘the upper end of the scapular arch. About thirty joints may be counted in
the single soft ray which represents the skeleton of the pectoral member.

The ribs fflare thirty-six pairs, all simple, slightly curvcd, slender stylos, at-
tached to the lower and lateral part of the fibrous capsule of the gelatinous
vertebral chord by an upper obtuse extremity, and pointed at the opposite end,
which projects into the intermnscular space, and from which the intermnscular
ligament is continued. They are all of nearly the same length, viz, about five
lines3 the posterior pairs become straighter and incline towards each other:
the thirty—seventh pair of corresponding appendages meet at their inferior ex-
