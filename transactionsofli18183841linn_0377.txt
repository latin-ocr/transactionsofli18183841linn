There can be no doubt that the present species comes very near to Iris ger-
manica, and indeed the points which separate them are few, and these not
strongly contrasted. That species is, however, distinguished by its shorter
scariose and ventricose spathes, entire sepals, longer and slenderer tube, and
lastly, by the more coarscly scrrated lobes of its stigmas. The rhizoma has
the fragranee of that of Iris florentina, and Dr. Royle informs me that it is
employed by the natives for similar purposes.

I suspect that this speeies will prove to be identical with the Irisjapcmica,
notwithstanding the difference presented by the colour of their flmvers, that
of Thunberg's plant being described to be white: for 1 have elsewhere re-
marked upon the fallacious character afforded by colour, as a test of specific
distinction, not only iu this genus, but throughout the greater part of the Mo-
nocotyledonous class, as is beautifully illustrated by the numerous cultivated
varieties of Iris Xiplzium and Xiphioicles. A series of eareful experiments are
still wanting to determine the exact limits of species in this genus.

The variety β. differs in nothing except in its shorter two-flowered scape,
and there are cultivated specimens of meludensi-5 from the Calcutta Gai-den in
the Wallichian Hcrbarium having this deprcssed character. In my character
of the species given in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society‚ I have described
the stem as compressed and furrowed; but these appearances presented by the
dried specimens prove to be the mere result of desiccation.
