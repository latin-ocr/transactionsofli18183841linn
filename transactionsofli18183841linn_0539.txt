esmpes, and also it teaches us that it is not always present.

Leveille in his Jle‘moire sur l'Ergot (Annales Soc. Linn. Paris, 1827, vol. 5,
p. 570) gives it as his opinion, that the presence of the liquid always precedes
the formation of the ergot, and from 011161· observations states, ‘⁵ De plus elles
nous 0111 appris que ce suc est un champignon dont le mode de developpemcnt,
l'organization et les effets meritent la plus grande attention'': this, however, does
not determine its origin ; but (p. 571 ) it 15 stated, ‘⁶ Si ee champignon traversa les
glumes saus (401011161- d'accident‚ on 16 voit a l'extremite de l'ergot‚ ou il forme
un tubercule janne.'' “Il laisse ecouler 1111 liquide visqueux :'' here is stated
the source of “a viseid liquid? which it is imagined is identieal with the one
under consideration, which is said 10 exude from the fungus at the apex of
the ergot3 but it will be attempted to be shown hereafter that this considered
fungus is 111 reality not 0116, 11111 a portion of the diseased ovary3 therefore, if the
fluid escapes from this, itin all probability has its origin in the diseased grain.

Philippar (Traite'tss‘c. sur l'Ergot (lu Seigle‚ p. 111,) 1116111165 10 the opinion of

‘⁶ La transudation du liquide cesse insensiblement 61 lorsque l'ergot a aequis
tout 5011 accroissement il n'y a plus de transudation.'' From these observations
it appears that the liquid escapes from the ergot3 but still 11 would be a mat-
ter of some interest to ascertain the precise point from which it flows, and to
acquire other information respecting it.

Having ascertained the healthy structure of the young grain, 1116 observa-
tions were directed to the earliest appearance of the erg0t; and it was found
that when influenced in its growth by the presence of a parasitic fungus (here-
01161 described), its healthy state was lost at a very early period, by the rapid
germination of the latter5 which, like others of its kindred, generated 111 a short
time an inconceivable number of reproductive atoms.

The first appearance of the young grain changing from its healthy condition
is manifested by its appearing swollen and softened, and possessing, as Leveille
and Philippar have described, a fctid disagreeable odourz in this state it breaks
