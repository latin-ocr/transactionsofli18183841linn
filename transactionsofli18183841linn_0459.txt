These gemmules with their numerous cilia may be 50011, 011 referring to the
drawings that accompany Dr. Farrc's paper, in Phil. Trans„ plate 26, at figs.

Dr. Grant has likewise published some observations on the spontaneous
motions of the ova of several Zoophytes‚ well worth perusal, in the Edinb.
New Phil. Journ. for 1826, at p. 150 and the following pagos&

Now, by comparing these descriptions with those before given of the germs
or sporules of Ectosperm‹1‚ and of the gerlnlike bodies both of the Spongilla
and of the Spongiw, it will be evident that these gemmules possess far more
vigorous and rapid powers of locoinoti0n‚ arising doubtless froin their finlike
cilia, and their actions exhibit inore volition or a greater degree of spontaneity‚
and precisely that which usually pertains to animal life : wherefore‚ they 1nore
nearly resemble in those powers the Infusorian Volvox. It likewise appears
from those authors, as well as froin the earlier accounts of Cavoliffl, that the
geniniules of Zoophytes frequently change their forms in swiinniing, that
they have considerable powers of contraction and dilatation of their whole
bodies, and are otherwise highly irritable; hence, in these characters they
present an essential difference both from the sporules of the River Sponge, and
from the gerinlike bodies of the Sea Sponges†: but these geunnules, in respect
to their irritability alone, much nearer approach the Itgfusoricm and thereby,
I think, their animal nature is sufficiently established. Also we know from
Dr. Unger's very conclusive experiments‚ that the locoinotive sporules of the
Ectosperma are those of a true plant; and since the moving germlikc bodies
of both kinds of Sponge are much more analogous in every respect to those,

* And for that author’s account of the ova of Fluslrae, see the same Journal sor 1827, p. 116. I
must however object to the tern] ova (eggs) being used to designate the reproductive bodies gem-
mules) of Zoophytes: because, these being euveloped by a mere skin or membrane, usually furnished
with cilia, endowed with irritability or powers of contraction and dihtation, and frequently, if not al·
ways, possessed of some kind of muscular apparatus, are rendered totally distinct from any ova or
mula, z'. e. such reproductive bodies as are simply inclosed within unorganized coverings or plain ex-
ternal 5110115. Although Dr. Allan Thomson incorrectly considers the distinction between cggs and
gemmules to be somewhat arbitrary. Vide note at p. 46 of Johnston's Brit. Zooph.

† Dr. Grant positively asserts the ova of the Sea Sponges “ do not change their forins while
swimming,' (p. 154, loc. cit.) And I have not witnessed either any such changes, or any syinptoms
of irritability, in the sporules of the River Sponge.
