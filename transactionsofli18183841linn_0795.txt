Nov. 21. READ the following ‘⁶ Notice of the discovery of Caculmlus bacci-
fer, L., in the Isle of Dogs.'' By ΜΓ. George Luxford, A.L.S.

“ The accompanying specimen of Cucubalus baccg'fee· was, with
many others, collected hy me in the Isle of Dogs in the early part ot'
last August. This plant was originally introduced into the British
Flora by Dillenius in the third edition of Ray's Synopsis. He there
speaks of it as having been gathercd in hcdges in Anglesea (Mona)
by ΜΓ. Fonlkes of Llanbedn, and 56111 by him to Dr. Richardson:
but in a letter from Mr. Foulkes to the latter gentleman, published
in the Linnean Corrcspondence, vol. ii. p. 171, he states, that he

the figure in English Botany, tab. 1577. Ι 11111, therefore, under the
necessity, however unwillingly, of excluding the Curubalus haccifer
from our British Flora? Ι1 was accordingly omitted when Sir James
published 1115 ‘ English Flora)

‘⁶ The locality in the Isle of Dogs is 011 1116 hanks of the ditch on
the left hand of the road from Blackwall to the Ferry Honse; and
there, ifnot trnly indigenous, it is at least perfectly naturalized. Ialso
feel convinced that Ι have met with it 111 5111111111· situations in other
parts of England ; 11111 1116 plant not being in flower, I have passed
it, as 1 did the first time Ι saw it 111 1116 Ι516 of Dogs, thinking it to
be merely Cerastium (tquaticum. It is probable that, like Polygonum
dumetorum, this plant only requires 10 have the attention of botanists
