Fig. l. Represents the obtuse placenta froin a flower-bud ᾗ a line long„ towards
the base of which 2 ovula are visible; these are at this period papil-
liforui, aud have no indicativus of distinction of coats or openings
through these.

Fig. 2. Ditto of a flowcr-bnd, {rds of a line long. The placenta is now elon-
gated towards its apex. The ovnla have assumed their mature forui.
There is still no tracc of distinct eoats, or of openings in thcni.

Fig. 3. Ovuluiu detacbed, with a portion of the placenta, froin a bud ot' about
the sanie size (ξι-(15 of a line long). It is a cellular mass, souiewhat
truncate, the cells being most lax at the apex. It. resembles in foi-in
and structure the nucleus of the ovuluiu of other plants.

Fig. -1. Represents the placenta of a flowcr-bud about a line long.

The placenta is still inore elongated. Towards its base two ovnla are
visible‚ the corresponding two being necessarily concealed. a. Re-
