456 Mr. E. J. QUEM-:Tr οη the Ergot qs'Rgse,

very easily in a transverse or any other direction, on very little force being
exerted for that purpose; it exhibits at this period, under the microscope‚ its
surface covered with a white mealy coating, which is mixed with cotton-like
lilamcntsit, separating with the utmost facility when the ergot is placed in
water and means are used for detaching it. This coating is not confined to
the body of the grain exclusively, for the particles and filanients of which it is
composed run over the anthers and stigmam, cementing them into one massj.
this fact is mentioned by Leveille‚ and figured by Philippar3 the particles
being found on the anther is noticed also by Mr. Smith, and they have been
detected by myself on the glumes and paleae.

This coming, when examined microscopically‚ is found to be composed of
minute bodies (sporidia), which are seen separated froin each other when they
are removed from the crgot3 but when viewed in their natural situation they
are seen occasionally united by their extremities, forming short moniliform
filaments3 but for the most part they are found irregularly agglutinated to
the surface, their connexion with each other being· so easily diSturbed if mois-
ture be applied to them. The coating is not smoothly distributed as regards
the surface it covers, but is composed of numerous flakes and also of sinuous
ridges†‚ similar to the convolutions on the exterior of the human brain, which
are arranged longitudinally upon the apex of the ergot, but dimiuish toward
thc base, and arc most distinct when the specimens arc about half grown.

At this stage the whole diseased grain does not measure more than one
sixth or one eighth of an inch, and the stigmas have become soinewhat
shrivelled, whilst the few liairs on its apex, and also the two scales at its base
remain unchanged. If a transverse section be made, it shows scarcely any-
thing bnt sporidia arranged about a very small and soft axis, which is of a
lobed, triangular, or irregular form; this axis is the grain very much altered
from its¹ normal condition, and presenting scarcely any analogy to the others
which retain their healthy character.

ss Resides these filaments, there are others which appear to nie as if they belonged to some other
pai-mite, which selects a damp situation for its growth, and hare no share in the production of the
ergot, their joints being not like those of the true coating, having seldom any granules within them,
and being more nearly rcctangular than elliptical, and occurring on many parts os the grass, and not

always on the body of the ergot.
