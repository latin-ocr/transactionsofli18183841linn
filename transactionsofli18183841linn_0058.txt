It is very diffie-ult to establish good generie. characters among the [111111111-
cese. KOELERm appears to nie to forn] a natural gretip, of which some of the
,species are arined and some are not, and there does not want a slight differ-
cnce of habit between these two divisions. The first form the genus Aiwelzlms
of Link, of which K. eri-stata may be taken 115 the type. The second trenehes

Festus-a, and it certainly does not exist in all the speeies. The crowded and
