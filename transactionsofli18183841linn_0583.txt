vulves.

A inore advanced sporule. The inass of cells which constitute the
gerni has here forced its way through the conical projection‚ which
is partly dilated and partly rupturcd‚ and lies concealed between the
gerni and the sporule. A few of the cells of the gerni have thrown
out rootlets.

. In this stage the cells of the gerni have assumed a inore meinhranous

character and a inore defined shape ; it will, in fuet, he found to eon-
tain the rudiments of a root and leaf. ιι. Fonr cells, which form the
quadrangular space mentioned in the description, and probably sinii-
lar to thc four projecting cells seen in fig. 12. The rootlets arc inore

numerous.

. A section of the last. sporule in outline. a a. The outer coat. l». The

conieal projection eoneealed by the gerni. c. One of thc valves.
dd. The outer cells of the gerni, separated from the central mass to
forn} a sheath for the leaf and root. <³ e. The place where the sheath
and central portion of the gerni reinain continuous. f. The arching
upwards of the gerni hy which the eavity of the sporule is enlarged.
g. The young leaf. Ιι. The young root. i. The first appearance of
vessels. As the germ grows, these vessels are prolonged into the
leaf and root.

sheath.

Fig. 18. The leaf and root have at length burst through the sheath. a. The

sheath at the tip of the root.

Fig. 19. In this specimen there are two leaves: the sheath has been opened

to show the bnd and the connexion of the parts. α (ι. a. The eut edge
of the sheath. h. The sheath cut close to its connexion with the
body of the gerni. The gerni is hollow as high up as the base of the
bud. The bud consists of a point, from which the first leaf, having

a tendency to gyration and a root, are in progress of development,
coneealed by a quantity of hairs.
