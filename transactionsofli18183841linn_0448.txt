372 [Ur. Hooo's observatiam οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

I felt assured of the extreme likelihood, nay, almost certainty, of their being
identical. And with the view of ascertaining whether they were or not such
animalcula, Ι put several of the germlike bodies into a wine-glass full of
spring-water, adding fresh daily to them; after a day or two their gyratory
motions became wcakcr and slower‚ and at length they entirely ceased: then
the bodies attaching themselves to the bottom and sides of the glass, and
losing their original shape, became flatter; the transparent membranes of
their upper portion disappearing, the white opake portions alone were left,
which, resembling minute specks, at the expiration of a few more days in-
creased to such a sufficient size as to show, with the aid of a magnifier, that
they are undoubtedly the rudiments of the Spongilla itself‚ and thus proving
that they are its reproductive bodies or sporules, and not merely, as I had con-
jectured, parasitical Itgfusot·ia*. I have taken the liberty of bringing for ex-
hibition this evening that same wine-glass, wherein the small specks are di-
stinctly seen, and which, when submitted to inspection under a microscope,
will be found to be the commencements of the Sponge, in which the young
fibres or spicula arc already visible.

One of these bodies Ι likewise put by itself in a watch-glass containing a
little water, which Ι placed 011 the stage of the microseope sor the purpose of
continuing to witness with that instrument more minutely its process of
‹levelopment; the water being changed two or three times a day, the germ-
like body at first moved a good deal about the glass; it then began to keep
nearly in the same place, only turning gently round as if on its axis; be-
coming afterwards stationary‚ it fixed itsclt' to the glass, and changed into
a small spot of a white opake substance; which, while growing iu the
water, appeared under the 1nicroscope to be solely gelatinous, but when it
had been dried for a day or two, minute cells and fibres or spicula were ma-
nifest.

At this time Ι was repeating the experiment of growing the Spongilla from
its seedlike sporidia or sporules, as Ι had only imperfectly done so in the
preceding March. Having taken many of these fresh seedlike bodies from

’¹‘ 1 must say, that it is probable that some of those bodies which are now referred to the Infusoria
will hereafter turn out to be only the sporules of certain fluviatile and marine plants.
