be imbricate. The stigma may as well be described as sultquinquelolmm as sub-
!rgfidum, for the carpellary number varies from three to five in most speeies.
L'Heritier's character of the fruit, as far as it goes, applics to all his specics.

Persoon in his synopsis (vol. ii. p. 74.) adopts L'Heriticr's views in nniting
Alstonia and Cipmn'nm with Symplocos, bnt again separatos IIopea ; und (ἑωυτ-
ner (Gapalogia, iii. p. 139. el seq. t. 2⁰⁹·f· 1, 2. 3.) not only follows Persoon in
considering the latter genus as well characterized by a pentapetalons corolla.
pentadelphous stamina, and a trilocnlar drnpe, bnt also rc-establishes Ciponim(1‚
distinguishing it chiefly by the stamina being in a double, not in a quadrnple
row, as in Sllsmplocos, the anthers bilocnlar‚ not qnadrilocnlar, the drnpe qua-
driloenlar, and the embryo erect, not inverted as in Ilolwa.

Of all these characters, those derived from the corolla and stamina alone
appear to be of any importance. The quadriloenlar anthcrs of Sismploros are a
mistake 3 the position of the embryo⁷ it is now well known, varies in *Sl‘lmld‘stvs
in different seeds in the same (hope, and the number of cells of the ovary is
very variable‚ at least. in the true specics of Symplaenurv.

On these grounds, probably, Bonpland (Pl. 4Ὲᾳιιῐη. i. p. Iso), followed by
Kunth, (Non. Gen. et Sp. Pl. Amer. iii. p. 256.) returns to L’Ileritier's opinion,
that the four genera form but one. In the first of these works Bonpland adds
to the six speeies then known eight new ones, and commences his monogra-
phie sketeh with a new character, in which the corolla is described as “ disco
epigyno imposita, polypetala vel monopetala3 polypetala7 petalis circiter lo,
duplici serie dispositis, exterioribus majoribus, basi in formam tubi arete co-
haerentibus, umnopetala, tubo brcvi, laciniis lo nt. in polypetala dispositis.''
This is evidently taken from S. Abs-tonia (Pl. „Equim t. 51.) and S. coccinea
(t. 522.); it is also applieablc, with a slight modification ns to the number of
petals of the inner series, to S. cernua (t. 53), but is completely at variance
as well with S. serrulam and S. rzgfescens, fignrcd in the same work (t. 54 & 55.)⁷
as with the original S. nzartinicensis, Aublet's Ciponima, and Linnzens's anea.

The subsequent additions to the genus consist chiefly of Asiatie species, of
which S. sinim was figured and described in detail by Ker in the Botanical
Register (vol. ix, t.710.)‚ the S. Lolm, δἰιηιιιηΐῐα, tlzeasfhlia, and cratwgoides
were established by D. Don, Prodr. Fl. A⁷epalcn.s·is, p. 144.. the S. racemosa,
spicata, andserrzeginea, by Roxburgh Fl. Iud. Or. vol. ii. p. 539. None of these
