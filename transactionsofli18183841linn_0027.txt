slIr. W ooos on the Genera (ff Eur-opem} Grassev. 13

some speeies of Andropngrm itself‚) where. in some genera the sessile spicula·
are perfect, and the stalked ones barren. Pairs or groups of spiculae occur
also in Digitaria, but on a one-sided rachis, and in Elymus and Hordeum,
where they are on a rachis with opposite ehaunels.

3. Spiculae solitary, in a paniole, with a rudimeut or imperfect floret within
the outer glunic of the calyx, or even with a rudiment or imperfect floret ou
each side, but below the perfect floret. This description applies to all thc
Pfflmmom except Lzsg*(1zzttz and Zea, which have only a doubtful claim to a
place in that tribe, and to Arrlwnatlzerum. Among the Om'zass also several
of the foreign genera are described as having indications, more or less com-
plete, of an imperfect inferior floret, though the two European genera exhibit
nothing of the sort. (renium among the CHLomnEAE, and some of the ROTT-
BOELLIACEAE, are said to have. exterual imperfect florets or rudiments, which,
however, occur in no European genus of these tribes. Panicum also would bc
included under this head.

4. Spiculze in two rows on one side of a flattencd rachis. This is the in-
florescence of the remaining Europcan Rxmcm aud of the CuLomnEAE. It
occurs, as already stated, in most species of „Indi-opagon, in ivamus, and in (jis-
nesto-us cristatus. In Knappia the rachis is not flattened or triangular. Tritis-am,
Nardus, and T. miilaterale belong to this division, and perhaps Oreoclzlmt.

5. Spiculae with more than one perfect floret disposed in a panicle equal all
round. This contains the remaining ARUNDINACEAE, the AVENACEAE, except
Arrlzenaflzeram3 and among the FESTUCACEAE, Pna, Glycerio aquatic-(1, Cata-
brusa, Melica, Molinia, Koeleria, Sclzismus, and Bromus.

6. Spiculae in a one-sided paniclc. In other respccts like the last. This
contains the remainder of the Festacacew, except Sea-leri«, which belongs to
the following.

7. Spiculae in a spike or head, tiled all round. llere we place Echimm-ia and
Sesleria.

8. Spiculae in opposite rows, on an alternately channcled rachis. This diri-
sion includes the Ihm-(leucen) and Rotth‹›elliacew‚ with some exceptions, which
have been already uoticed. The description would also apply to [ἷξε-[παι mari-
tima (Τνίίῐυαηι maritimwn, Auen), aud F. divaricata, and to Gaudium (Arena)

fragilis.
