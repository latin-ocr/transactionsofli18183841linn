Most naturalists have considered the Vertebrate 111111111115 10 form four di-
5111101 classes, eliaraeterized hy 115 many leading modifications of the respira-
tory (›1·galis; Manunals, e. g„ being distinguished hy having lungs eoniposed

vity: Birds, by having spongy lungs 111-11111 adherent to the posterior parietes
of the thorax, 111111 generally coniiuunieating¹ with air-cells continued into the

of Reptiles.

In the Lepidosiren, however, we have a eold-hlooded vertebrate animal, of
which Ι 111111· say in the very words of Cuvier when speaking of the Siren.

it strictly and z‹s›ologieally a Batraehianz not, however, because the heart
