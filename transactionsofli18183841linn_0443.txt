Ζοορ11.”) thus mentions what he considered remarkable specimens: ‘⁶ Spongia
vulgaris fluviatilis in aquis stagnantibus saepi¹ crassis crustis fundum obducit.
Talis crustae fragmenta parvulis Pl1131sg‹1near1mz larvis, membranaceis tubulis
in spongiosa substantia nidulantibus scatentis monstravisse mihi 011111 511111-
11111111 apud Goettingenses Botanicuin celeberr. Biittnerum 1ne1ni11i3 nec simi-
les unquam invenire ipse potui.'' So one of my specimens will show how this
Sponge is seen occasionally to fix itself and to spread upon the tube or case of
a Caddis or Cadeworm, as related in the passage just cited. Another speci-
men here presented is interesting from its parasitical mode of growth, because
it has invested a 111055 (Hypnum riparium, Linn.) in a very beautiful manner.
Ι11 short, Ι may safely infer, from the many different substances to which Ι
have noticed the Spongillafluviatilis attached, and from the many carious
places wherein Ι have observed its seedlike bodies growing, that wherever one
of these bodies can obtain a lodgement for itself, there it increases and flou-
rishes 11, and consequently, that these bodies are in fact the true sporules† or
ovules of the River Sponge, be it a vegetable or an animal production.

Lastly, I beg to submit to your notice three specimens of the small fresh-
water Polypary, named Plamatella repens by De Lainarck, which I discovered,
for the first time Ι believe in England, in the month of August last among
some patches of the Spongilla froin the same rivulet.

* Two or three of these seedlike bodies having lodged in the mouths or openings of two fluviatile
shells that form part of the case of the caddis or larva Pht-yyunece, now exhibited, clearly prove this:
they also show how the spongc begins to be developed.

† Having yesterday received the new number (for July 1838) of the ‘¹ Annales (165 56160665 Natu-
relles,'' seconde serie, tom. x. Zooloqie, I have just peruscd the “ Observations sur les Eponges et en
particulier sur la Spongille ou Eponge d'eau douce, par M. F. Dujardin.” At page 9, this author, who
is convinced of the animality of Sponges, states, “Dans 665 diverses parcelles vivantes, on voit des
granules colores en vert au printemps, griscs ou jaun-atres a l'arriere-saison, et que je ne puis regarder
comme des organes importans, ou comme des ovules de l’Eponge.'' But the experiments mentioned
in the preceding notes at page 366, will entirely rcfute the opinion of M. Dujardin, and prove without
a doubt that these are in reality the reproductive bodies of the Sponyz'lla. On the other hand,
M. Dutrochet, in his very able ‘⁴' Observations sur la Spongille rameuse (Sponqilla ramosa, Lam.‚
Ephydatia lavastris, Lamour.,'’ Sponyia lacuscris, Linn.)‚ and 111 which he advocates the vegetability
of that species of Sponge, adds concerning its seed-like bodies, “Ces corps sont donc des especes
