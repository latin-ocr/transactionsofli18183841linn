the two flowers are completely united into one, with a double num-
bcr ofparts in each of the circles. But the most remarkable instance
of this kind of union with which he has met occurs in a specimen of
Scrophularia nodosa, found at lVater F ulford, near York, in which
four flowers are united into one. In this case several monstrous
flowers occur on the same branch, but are generally unions of only
two flowers‚ and the terminal flowers are invariably of the ordinary
structure. This Mr. Hincks regards as what might be expected in
a plant with centrifugal inflorescence, where the monstrosity cou-
sists of a union of flowers3 whereas in the same kind of inflorescence,
when the monstrosity consists iu a more full and equal development,
the centra] flower might be expected to be the first affected; and
this actually occurs in a specimen which he possesses of a species of
Linaria with all the terminal flowers (and those alone) pelorinted.
In the stalk of the flower of *S'croplmlaria nodosa referred to, Mr.
Hincks thinks he can recognize the junction of 4 peduncles3 the
number of sepals is 15, one of them being narrow and somewhat
displaced3 that of the petaIS‚ which all cohere together, 16. Of
these, 7 are the lower or more developed petals‚ which are upright in
the limb and are united iu pairs. These are altogether in one line at
the back of the flower, and the position of a stamen shows the sup-
pression of one part where the additional sepal has been preserved.
Of the upper or reflexed petals only 9 remain 3 and as there are 3 of
these in each ordinary flower, if one be supposed to have perished at
each juncture, according to the analogy of the Irides and OEnotheroe,
the whole number will be accounted for. The number of stamens is
20, or 5 to each flower3 one of these has its anthei· abortive and
changed into a scale, and there are several instances of two being
united together, hut all may be distinctly traced. There are three
distinct ovaria, two of which belong each to one flower, having
the usual bilocular structure3 the third Mr. Hincks regards as rna*
nifestly belonging to two flowers‚ but made up of 8 cells instead of 4.
He found several 3-locula1· ovaria ou the same plant; but in this in-·
stance he believes there are 4 cells developed for each flower, their
