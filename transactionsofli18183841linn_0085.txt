the style to the apex of the cell. The placenta is pushed com-
pletely to one side, and froul the enlargcment downwards of the cel-
lular body, their bases do not cmrespond, as in fig. 13. A cavity
is apparent at the apex of the cellular body.

very few globules or inolecules are visible‚ aud they are either sta-
tionary or sluggish.

With this exception it agrees with the abortive ovula examincd in
earlier stages.

Fig. 19. Represents a long section of the ccllular body at a period later thau
that. of fig. 15. The einbryo is seen in situ.

Fig.20. The same eulbryo detached. The apex of the. cellular body remains,
and to this the einbryo is seen to be attached. There is an evident
commencement of the cotyledonary division visible at its lower ex-
tremity.

Fig. 21. Einbryo froin an ovariuui 4 lines long. The fruit is now nearly at its
full developmentg the mesocarp is indurated, aud the endocarp is
reduced to a spongy coating, which adheres to the indu rated, nearly
osseous inesocarp, and likewisc to the ‘⁶ albumens' This body now
occupies the entire eavity of the fruit, and has assumed its niature
for1n3 it is white and fleshy, and abouuds with fecula. The einbryo
is about 2 lines long, it is included in the “ alb11111e11,'' but is not
exactly axile. The apex or radicle is ovate and attenuate, and points
to the upper portion of the ‘⁶ albumen? and towards the apex of the
placenta, which is still visiblc, lodged in a depression on its stu-face.
The cotyledons are plano-convex, mutually applied by their plane
faces. The plumula is inconspicuouS.

Ι trust that the accompanying sketches will be found sufficient.
