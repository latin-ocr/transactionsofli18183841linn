The major part of the selected species belong to the Longicorn Beetles, and
as Ι do not accord with the arrangement of Monsieur Audinet Serville (pub-
lished in the French Entomological Transactions), particularly in the group-
ing of the Lamiatloe of Leach, it may be adviseable to commence with some
short observations on the Lamiadw.

The typical species of Lamia, according to Fabricius, was Lamia Gigas;
that species is now (letached from Lamia by Serville, under the. generic name
of Omacsmtha. The type of true Lamia, according to the above author, at
present appears to be either Lamia Rabas, Fab.‚ or some other closely allied
species. He has, however, included under the same head three other species,
differing considerably in form, and which may be regarded as subgenera be-
longing to another family. The natural sections of Lamia appear to be three;
first, those which have the sutural apex of the elytra acuminated, each wing
being internally more or less spiny, whilst the lateral angles are invariably
rounded; secondly‚ those which have the sutural apex spiny, as well as the
lateral angles spinose3 and thirdly, those which have the elytra rounded at
the apex, and without any spines medial or lateral. The last section requires
still further snbdivision, and most willingly do I leave that task for others. It
is time, however, to proceed to the description of the species. 1 commence

This magnificent species I have named in honour of Dr. Horsfield, the au-
thor of a valuable work on the metamorphosis of Indian Lepidaptera. With
regard to size, the species ranks amongst the largest of the Lamiada’ which
have yet been described as belonging to the East. Lamia catenata of De
Haan, from Japan, is a species closely allied to it. It differs, however, in
