a. First lobe of the tongue. l). Second lobe of the tongue. s. c. Di-
varicated sides of the pharyngeal apel-ture, which has been slit
open. (Ι. Pharyngeal valve. e. Laryngeal aperture. f. Laryn-
geal or *thyroid cartilage. The figures 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5, indicate the
interspaces between the six branchial arches on each side, which
conduct the water to the branchial chamber. ἦ. The membra—

right lung is shown.

2. The sanie parts, with the heart‚ seen from the ventral aspect. a. The
auricle 3 the letter is placed on the left appendix. b. The ventricle,
laid open to show the teruiination of the vena pulmonalis, in which

f. Vena pulmonalis. g. Arterial trunk common to the systemic‚
branchial and pulmonary circulations. The figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 δε 6,
