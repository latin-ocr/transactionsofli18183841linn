that they are in fact neither the nidus or matrix, nor the fabrication or pro-

lt is to 1110 11ον01·11101055 11 subject not altogether certain, and 0110 worthy ot*

Linnceus, as it will be 1011101111101011, 111 1115 Flora Lapponica‚ 01111.. 1737, and
Flora Suecica, edit. 1745, placed the Spongia lavastris and ›Sssflurialil'is 111 his
class Cryptogamia, and order Litl10pl1yta; but in the earlier editions of his
Genera Plantaruin, and of his Species plantarum, he distributed both the Sea
and Freshwater Sponges in his class C'EJIffOgsffllif'· and order lllgoe.

In a work of a late date, 1111111011, “A Natural Arrangement of British
Plants‚'' by Mr, S. F. Gray, both 1110 811011ςὶΗο 111111 1110 Sea Sponges are classed
in the Fam. 2. lealassioplzyta, which belongs 10 1115 Subseries Ι. Planta> Cel-

Professor Link has very recently stated, in the work§ quoted in the begin-

that all the Sponges would be 111010 correctly arranged in an 11110111101111110
