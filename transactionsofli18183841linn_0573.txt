56611011, however, we can observe this process at an earlier period ; 111111 Ι 111111,
upon reinoving the conical projection, that the 11151 evidence of gerniination

valved portion of the internal 111611111111116, which is 1111115111116111ς 111111 Ι now
find, for the first time, a very delicate pellucid 111611111111116 lining the whole
cavity of the sponde, 111111 having the cells, which give the appearance just
mentioned, either lying 011 115 external surfaec, or forming 111111. portion of it
which lies beneath the valves. From the appearances⁷ and the inipsmsibility
of scparating the cells froni the 111611111111116, Ι 11111 inclined to believe that the
cavity formed by this nicinbrane is conipleted by the cells, or, in other words,
that the sac is partly ineinbranous and partly cellular (Tm. XXXIV. fig. 111
& l 1.). It is possible that this last-described 111611111111116 may exist before ger-
1111111111011 begins, notwithstanding the numerous unsucccssful dissections which
I have made to discover it, 1116 failure being owing to its extreine delicacy3

have not the slightest difficulty in demonstrating it after that has coinnicnced‚
nor is there the slightest 111166 of it in any stage of 1116 development of the
sporulc. However this may be, it is quite certain that fresh cells 1116 gradu-
ally formed on 1116 external surface of the cellular part of the 5116, 111111 111111

1111111611, 111111 acquire a reddish-brown hue, and in the advanced stage of ger-
1111111111011 appear like a brown quadrangular space, which Ι should have little
