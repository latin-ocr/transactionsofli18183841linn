And a portion of it is translated in an article “ On the Metamorphoses of the
Reproductive Bodies of some Algw, said to possess successively an animal
and a vegetable Existence‚” in the Mag. of Nat. Hist. vol. i. 110. 4. for Novem-
ber 1828, p. 307, and is illustrated by a wood-cut. Here the locomotive glo-
bules, or more eorrectly the sporules or germs of the Ectosperma clarata, are
described as being ‘⁶ oval‚ dark at one extremity‚ and almost transparent 111
1110 011101·;” which characters exactly resemble those of the sporules of the
-S'pongillm Also the account of their movements and mode of swimming is
very nearly the same, and is thus translated in p. 307: “ The minute globules
(were) unequal both 111 0010111· and size. Many of them swam freely here and
there, moving at their optimi, in one way or another, retiring and approaehing
one another, gliding round globules that were motionless, stopping‚ and again
setting themselves in motion exactly like animated beings.'' I have therefore
no hesitation in asserting that the movements of both are in all probability
effected by the same means.

But it unfortunately does not appear from Unger's figures 111 tab. 410, 111111
any powerful microscope had been used to magnify the locomotive sporules 111
question, in order to prove whether or not they possessed 011111, or any 011101·
like organs, by which their motious might be partly or altogether performed.
Nevertheless I have taken much trouble 111 endeavouring to ascertain by what
means the sporules of the River Sponge swim and move about.

Under the highest power of Jones's improved compound microscope‚ with
which my observations on these sporules, whilst in their fresh and locomotive
state, were made, I could only pereeive certain rapid streams or currents
taking· place on their sides, which induced 1110 10 think they were cui-rents or
vibrations in the water caused by little tufts of cilia, with which the membra-
nous coverings of the sporules seemed to be furnished‚ and by which their
movements‚ as Ι fancied‚ were effected. But having selected many of these
sporules when in full possession, and at the time they were actually making
use, of their moving power, I preserved them in a phial of spi1·its²²¹‘: some of
these I have lately (November 26th) re-examined under a more modern and
perfect instrument, one of Powell's compound miei·oscopeS‚ and belonging· to

'⁶' This phial, containing many of these locomotive sporules immersed in spirits, l beg to present to
the Society.
