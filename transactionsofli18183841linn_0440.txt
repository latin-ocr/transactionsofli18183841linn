and principally by examining its manner of growth from its small seedlike
body, and by comparing it with the similar origin and increase of certain Cryp-
togamic vegetables from their seeds or sporules ; and by contrasting it with the
mode of formation of 501110 of the lower animals from their minute eggs or
0111105, 501110 fact very probably may be elicited which is found to take place
only in the one division of nature, and not in the 011101, and thereby enable him
to determine with accuracy to which it ought really to be referred.

These seedlike bodies on being magnified 50 exactly resemble true 500115, that
it is difflcult to imagine that they can be the gerins or ovules (offula) of ani-

the Sonth American Quinoa (Clienopmllmn Quinoa). But they must 110 steeped
a little while in water before they 1110 placed under the microscope, in order
to raise their tops or upper portione, which, resembliiig small dimples‚ by de-
siccation contract or become somewhat drawn in.

The seedlike bodies, sporidia, or spondes, if the Sponge’lla be 11 vegetable‚ or
small ova, or ovules, isan animal, which are 50 numerous in the largest speci-

belonging to the Lake Sponge* (Spongilla measti-is), and which are figured in

* Professor H. F. Link in a very interesting mcmoir, wherein 110 says that the Sponges ought to
be separated from the Zoopliyles and restored to the sllyae, has well described the seedlike bodies or
sporidia of the Sym-(silla lacastris. Ι was unfortunater not aware of its existence till long after my
