arches which support the gills, is subject to a previous tiltration by the interlock-
ing marginal denticles ; while that which flows between those two branchial
arches from which no gills are developed has a free and uninterrupted passage.

The gills do not form any cxternal projection, as in the gill—bearing Peren-
nibmnchians, but are contained in a moderately,capacious branchial chamber,
the parietes of which are formed by a mucous and muscular stratu1n*; the
external outlet is the vertical slit already described, situated innnediately antc—
rior to the filamentary pectoral member.

Thus although the organs for respiration through the medium of water corre—
spond in all cssential points with thos(¹ of the true Fishes, yet the gills approxi-
mate in their filainentary form to those of the Perennibranchiate Reptiles. And,
again, although the gills are four in number on each side, as in the Osseous
Fishes, yet the number of branchial apertures and arches corresponds with that
which characterizes the higher Cartilaginous Fishes. »So that while we pemeive,
even in the organs for breathing water, a tendency towards the amphibious
type, we find at the same time that the branchia! as well as the osseous
system manifests a most interesting· and hitherto unexamplcd transitional
structure between the Plagiostonious and Osseous Fishes.

We have next to consider that part of the Rcspiratory System which is or-
ganized for breathing immediately the atmospheric air, οι· the Lung·s†: for I
know not how otherwise to designate, according either to their physiologica] or
morphological relations, those organs, which in the technical language of the
ichthyologist would be termed the swim- or air-bladder.

The t1·11‹·leea‡‚ or7 to use the same technical and partial nomenclature, the
‘ductus pneutnaticus‚' is a short wide membranous tube, as in the Perenni-
branchiate Reptilcs. The glottis-g& opens near the posterior part of a long
rudimental thyroid cartilage3 a few lines posterior to the isthmus sitacium
the opposite end of the trachea dilates into a membranous sac which com-
municates by two large lateral apertures with the lungs. These are widest
at their anterior extremities, and gradually decrease in diameter to the cloaca,
behind which they terminate each in an obtuse point. They are lodged in
the dorsal angle of the abdominal cavity behind the kidneys> and are attached
