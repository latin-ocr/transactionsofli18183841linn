and as long, or nearly as long as the spieula‚ and this contains, except in
Lagnrus and in Art-ltmatthei-unz, two or more perfect florets. With the excep-
tion of the latter genus, the tendency of this tribe is to perfect its lower floretS,
while the upper ones are frequently imperfect and tabescent. The paleae are
unequal in substance, the outer being much the firmest, frequently strongly
ribbed, and generally with a seariose margin or extremity. The inner is alto-
gether scariose, except on the two keeled nerveS, permanent, and emhracing
the seed⁴ A jointed and twisted awn rises from the back of the outer palea,
but this is sometimes wanting. The inflorescenee is in a pauide, spi-eading
all round, except in Gaudium, where. it is in a spike² the spicula} being in
opposite rou-s on a fragile, alternately channelled rachis. The inequality of
substance in the paleae, and the greater tirmness of the outer, as compared to
the ghunes, may he added to the marks already pointed out, which distinguish
these plants from the Arzmdimleeoe. They are separated from the Festucaceoe
chiefly hy the nature of the awn, hy the stiff hairs at the base of the floret,
and by the greater comparative length of the glnmes. Unfortunately‚ the stiff
hairs at the base of the floret do not always exist3 nor is the dorsal, genicu-
late awn always present. The awn or seta among the Fe.s·tueaeew is never
genienlate, although it is somewhat eurved and twisted in some species of
Bromius: hut the awn in the. Avensa-ew arises from the substance of the paleae,
and never from the uniones several nerves as in that genus, while in the other
genera of lias-tmmew it. is evidently a mere continuationi of the midi-ih.

The genera are :

l. Aira. Glnmess 2-flowered, without. any rudiment. Onter palea nei-veless‚
included. Awn, if any, dorsal, geniculate.

2. I)es‹·lm»1p.s·ia. Glumes keeled, containing (but not including) :2 perfect
flor-ets, and the. rudiment of a third more or less developed. Awn dorsaL
straight.

3. Lc'1g10705. (illimes l-flowered‚ scariose, ending in a long fringed seta!
Outer palea nerved, ending in two long setae and an inter-mediate genicu-
late and twisted dorsal awn.

4. 'li-[setam. Glumes 2—(5—flowered, membranous, not exceeding the florets.
Outer palea scm-iose, without nei-ves or any distinct keel, ending in two
