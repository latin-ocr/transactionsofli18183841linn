I HAVE taken the liberty of troubling you with some specimens of the River
Sponge (Spongilla fluviatilis), for the purpose of calling the attention of the
members of the Linnean Society to this curious substance, and more particu-
larly to the seedlike bodies which are so abundantly contained in one of them.
⁴ This species of Sponge is synonyinous with Spongiafluviatilis, Linn. and
Pallas, Spongilla friabilis (De Lamarck)‚ Epltydatiafluviatilis (Lamouroux),
Tuplza fluviatilis (Oken), and I-Ialiclmndriafluviatilis (Fle1ni11g); and was
taken by me last August from a rivulet at Norton in the county of Durham.
Yon will perhaps be surprised that Ι should even hint at, much less cx-
press any doubts respecting thc animal nature of the Freshwater Sponge3 for
modern naturalists have long been almost unanimous in assigning to it a
station in the class Zoophytes, and in which are likewise included the Ma-
rine Sponges. But I must mention that Dr. George Johnston, who is both
an excellent zoologist and botanist‚ has decided upon restoring the Sponges
to the place they formerly occupied in the vegetable kingdom; and Ι will
merely refer you to his reasons for this decision in his “History of British
Zoophytes,” given in the first volume of the ‘⁶ Magazine of Zoology and Bo-
tany‚” at pages 229 and 230. Hence it appears that there still exists aniongst
authors some uncertainty concerning their true nature& Now, my chief
object in exhibiting these specimens of Spongilla is to endeavour to excite
some naturalist to make attentive observations on this singular producffion,
