appears to answer to the testa ot' the seed, and also to the external or purple
0110 of the ergot‚ the colouring matter it contained having assumed a deeper
shade: this is made 111-0111111Ιο as there is observed on the exterior of some
ergots what appear to be the remains of the pericarp‚ which adheres in irre-
gular little filmy pieces, and are occasionally 50011 external to the purple layci·

The purple coat 15 1101, as Phoebus figures it, composed of elongated cellular

The terminal point or cap of the ergot, when examined 1nicroscopically‚
appears to be a heterogeneous mass of structure; being composed externally
of the cerebrit'orm coating of withered pericarp and of the 5110111110, which
cements together the various hairs that are found on the exterior of the grain,
and which incloses likewise what is conceived to be the remains of 1110 peri-
