30 Mr. Woons (m the Genera qf Europemz Grasses.

European species, which is united by Kunth to Sporoboluffi but it. wants the
mluble pericarp so renmrkable in that genus. There is some difference of
appearance between this plant and Agr-estt'S, to which, however, it perhaps
might be reunited without impropriety.

Of Aonos'ms Palisot de Beauvois makes 5 genera. Agr—aulos, palea only l,
awned. Triclwdium, palea l, unarmed. Agros-tis, paleae 2, the outer one
awned. l'ilsit, paleae 2, una1·1ned; and Apera (Agrestis spica venti), which is
separated on account of the almost terminal position of the awn.

Sir J. E. Smith says that the corolla in this genus is usually larger than the
calyX. In all the species which I have had the opportunity of examining,
except in Α. spica venti and A. interrupta, forming the genus Aper-a of Palisot
de Bcauvois, the corolla is decidedly smaller than the glumes. Kunth says,
“glumae florem plerumque multo superantes,'' and the figures of Palisot de
Beauvois and of Reichenbach agree in representing the corolla as smaller than
the calyx.

comixNTnus is a delicate little Grass, of which we know only one species,
aud this seems to be confincd to Bohemia. It cannot be confounded with any
other, nor, Ι think, joined to any other tribe.

Kunth places KNAPPIA among the lelarideoe3 of course it would in that
case belong to the division of the tribe which 1 have separated under the name
of Phleine(e; but on the whole, 1 have preferred numbering it among the
Agros-tidem in spite of the peculiarity of its infl01·escence‚——a peculiarity which
has induced Sir W. Hooker to place it among the spiked Grasses. The palea
is very thiu and tender, truncate and lacerate at the top, and covered with a
sort of shagginess, which seems rather to consist of torn-up portions of its
substance than of hairs. These circumstances render it very difficult to tell
whether or not there is au inner palea, as it is not easy to exhibit the outen-
without tearing it, and impossible to decide from its appearance when dis-
played whether it has been torn or not.

I have been very much at a loss to know by what name this Grass ought to
be called. Adanson, who first separated it from Agr-ostis, called it mmm-(13
‘⁶ but,” says Sir J. E. smith, “that author's names, so often founded on bad
principle, have been generally neglected.” The next name was Clzamfczgrostim
and surely if Mibora was founded on a bad principle, this rests upon a worse,
