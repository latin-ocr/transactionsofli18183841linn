are barren in some genera and perfect in others. The. glumes are firm, nearly
equal, inelosing the 11111010, whieh are thiu, and often filmy, but bearing a
strong awn. The infloreseenee is panieular, except in Amlropogon, where
most of the speeies produce their 5111011110 111 two rows on 1110 same side of a
flattened rachis3 and the 51111105 or raeemes thus formed are frequently dis-
posed in pairs or digitate. Flowers indeterminate sets 000111· among the
Pania-ew, which, however, are easily distinguished by the coriaeeous paleae.
They are also found iu Ihmleam, 111111 111 501110 foreign genera among the
Rottboelliacew. Elymus and Lygeum have two or three spieulae together,
but they offer nothing of a systematie arrangement.
'l‘he genera of this tribe may 110 thus disposed:

A. 8111011110, 1111 fertile, elothed with long silky hairs. Glumes thiu.

l. Sacclmrum. Paleae unarmed, the 1111101· 51111111 or wanting. Squamulae 2.
Paniele not Ι5111110-11110.
2. Imperant. Paleae 2, unarmed. Squamulae none. Paniele spike-like. Rachis

abruptly flexuose, continuous.

ε’. Eriantlms. 011101·11111011111ν11011. Squamulae 2. Paniele spreading. Rachis
hardly flexuose, very brittle.

B. Lateral or stall<ed 5111011110 11111·1·011.

4. „Indropogom Spieuhe linear-lanceolate, eompressed. Seeds nearly linear.

ἴ. Soiglmm. 8111011110 ovate or ovato-lanceolata turgid. Glumes of the fer-
tile floret eoriaeeous or horny. Seed roundish.

Imperant and Eriantlms differ, as stated above; but these distinctions are
not sufficient to constitute genera unless supported by 11 marked peeuharity of
habit ; 111111 where we have only one 51100105 of a genus, as in hustet-ala, we ean
hardly aeknowledge some differenee of general appearance to deeide the
question, sinee we have no proof of its having any connection with the eha-
raeter. I may add to 1110 foregoing description of Imperant, that in all my
¹spee'uuens the styles are united in the lower part. The very tough and horny
