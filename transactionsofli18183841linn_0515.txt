INSECTS from the Burmese territories, or from Assam, are equally rare ; a
few species some years since were brought to England by the late General
Hardwieke, from the latter country, and they are now deposited along with
his valuable collection of Oriental zoology in the British Muscum. A second
collection fron] the same locality, consisting of two glazed cases, were pre-
sented to me by Lady Jones. The nondescripts of a third also were kindly
given me by Dr. Cantor, the celebrated herpetologist. The only insects from
the same regions of my acquaintance which I have not mentioned, (with the
exception of Mr. Solly's,) are some magnificent species figured in the Trans—
actions of the Entomological Society of London; they were transmitted from
the East Indies to Mr. Rucker: all of them are described as inhabitiug the.
East; 110 specific locality, however, happens to be stated. Recognising every
species in Mr. Solly's collection (with one exception only), and some of them
in considerable numbers, I do not hesitate to give an opinion, that they were
also collected in the territories of Assam. The insects which Ι now proceed
to describe for the Linnean Society are entirely new to European entomolo-
gists3 some of them are remarkable for magnitude, splendour, and colouring,
and I regard them as equal, if not superior, to any of the choicest specimens
of our metropolitan cabinets. By permission of Mr. SoHy, Ι described a por-
tion of the rarities for the Entomological Society of London 3 the more splen-

did Ι have reserved for the Linnean, and which I now submit to the notice of
its members.
