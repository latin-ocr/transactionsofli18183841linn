‘2⁴28 Mr. BENTHAM'S Ohservatimzs on some Genera (gf Plcmls

authors, however, appear to have much studied the genesio character, which
they have taken more or less from some of the above-mentioned botanists,
Don observing only ‘⁶ Genus forte iterum dividendum.”

Since the above Ι am not aware ef any modification in the character or spe-
cies of Symplmvs, until the publication of the last volume of G. Don's General
System ef Gardening and Botany‚ where all the hitherto published speeies are
collected, those merely named in lerlliell's Catalogue are described, the genus
is retained as established by L'Ileritier and Bonpland, but. raised to the rank
of a natural order, and divided into three sections: Ala-tonia, containing all
the American speeies said to be distinguished by an S—-lO-parted corolla, the
segments in a double row, stamens in :3 01· 4 scr-ies, and a half inferior (lrupe3
Lmllnw, consisting of 17 Asiatic species5 to which are attributed a 5-parted
corolla, stamens inserted without order, and an inferior drupe; and Palm-(1,
described as having the same corolla, with stamens in a triple series, and an
inferior ovary. Under this seetion are enumerated two remaining Asiatic
speeies.

These characters, however, by no means coi-respond with the speeifie eha-
racters given in the same work to several of the speeies, and will bc found on
examination still more at variance in many instances with the plants thein-
selves. Thus in the seetieu Abs-tonia, three speeies at least have a 5-parted
corolla, the seg-ments¹ in many of them are not in a double row3 the statuens
of S. tinctor-ia are arranged as in the Asiatic species, and the calyx is as ad-
herent [υ the drupe in Abs-tonia as in Lmlln'a and Palm-a. In the latter respect
l cannot see any different-e between the S. sina-a and the several plants referred
to Lodlzra3 and if there is any greater regularity in the arrangement of the
stamina in S. cratwgoitles· than in Lotllnw, it is that they are more decidedly
pentadelphous and not biseriate.

Amidst all these conl‘lieting opinions, after a eareful examinatior} of a con-
siderable number of both American and Asiatie species, it appears to me that
there do exist three distinet groups·‚ whieh it might be adviseable to consider
as so many genera. In the true ›szsmplows of Linnaeus the stainina are ercet,
the filaments are flat, monaulelphous at the base, free in the upper part, where
they are distinetly imbrieated in three or four rows, and suddenly attenuated
below the anthei-z the corolla is creet and adherent to the stamiual tube,
