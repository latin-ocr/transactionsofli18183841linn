400 illr. Hooo's Observations οη the. Spongilla fluviatilis,

inclined to believe belonged to them, and which the statement made by so
high an authority as Baron Cuvier, in his first edition of the Regae Animal&
induced me partly to acquiesce in. Since. the year 1823, Ι have not¹ had an
opportunity of re-examining any of the Sea Sponges in a living state and in
their native clement. But the subsequent¹ investigations of Professor Grant, and
of other observers, have clearly determined that they are not endowed with the
least irritability.

Being so wedded to my former opinion of the animality of all Sponges, and
being by my researches on the River Sponge at length assured of its vegeta-
bility, Ι then began to imagine, agreeably with the suggestions expressed by
Montagu†, Dc Lamarckss, and Bellgi, that it might possibly be quite a dif-
ferent substance from the Sea Sponges3 and if so, these latter might be yetv
esteemed of a true animal naturell. Howcver, still more recent and minute
comparisons of many of these, as preserved in several collections with the
,Spongillrss have compelled me to abandon that idea3 for I cannot. find any
more solid ground for it, than for holding that one genus of the Fzmgi, as
illm-alius, belongs to a perfectly distinct division of nature, from another
genus of the same order, for instance, Agaricus; and as all who should
behold them would immediately and unhesitatingly acknowledge both the
one, and the other, to be a true Mushroom or szgus3 so we are equally
obliged to admit, that the Spongia and Spongilla are in fact both real Sponges ς,
indeed there scarcely is even so much as a generic difference between them ;
and in this, with the earlier naturalists Dr. Flemingql coincidcs, for he places
both kinds in one and the same genus, ffizlichondria.

Both the Freshwater and the Sea Spongcs are furnished with a skeleton ot
fibres intret-lacing, crossing, and anastomosing with themselves3 generally also
strengthened with those singularly crystallized particles termed spicula ; with
a parenchymatous soft portion or jelly; with a fine and transparent envelop-
