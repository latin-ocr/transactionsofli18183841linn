within the body of the ovulum. At the period of their greatest activity they
are more mobile when contained in the tubes than when they are made to
escape into the fluid medium surrounding them. No change, exeepting in
size, occurs in the ovula up to the period of the application of the male influa
enee to thessstiginata. The tubes remain in apposition to the placenta, and
continue to be simple, membranous, elongated‚ closed sacs. There is, per-
haps, a tendency in many of the molecules to become aggregated in the
dilated apices of the tubes.

Shortly after the period above alluded to exceedingly fine filaiuents are
visible in the canal existing in the centre of the style, down which they pass
to the apex of the placenta and become firmly applied to the extreme points
of the tubes, more than one being generally found in apposition with each
tube. From a solitary entrance Ι imagine them to terminate in dilated cul de
sac-s, or rather, to use the Frencb term, in a pate d'oie3 Ι must renmrk, how-
ever, that in most cases they have appeared blended with the substance of the
tubes, although in no case do they appear to pleorate tbe membrane. At
this time the molecules will be almost, invariably found to bave lost their
motion and to have become denselyaggregated into a gruruous, opake‚ central
body, reaching froin the apex of the tube to the apex of the ovulum. This is,
however, frequently interrupted‚ but Ι believe that this is to be attributed to
pressure du ring the operation of separating the ovula from the placenta. The
tubes now adhere to the placenta, especially throughout the upper two thirds
of their length3 and on separating them, portions of the cellular tissue of the
placenta to which they were applied become detached, and are visible adher-ing
to the membrane of the tubes. Owing to this adhesion the tube itself appears
to be occasionally cellular. A vesicle, generally of a globular form, and fre-
quently appearing to contain mobile granules or moleeules‚ is now visible int
and occupying the chief part of the apex of the tube. Ι have not been able to
trace any continuity between this vesicle and the filaments stated to descend
through the style to the tubes. The lower margin of this vesicle is in appo*
sition with the upper portion of the grumous, opake, central mass, which Ι
bave described above as resulting from an aggregation of the inoleculcs. The
part of the tube adjoining the apex of the nucleus is now visibly cnlarged,
Iu addition to the molecules which it contains a small central cell is apparent,
