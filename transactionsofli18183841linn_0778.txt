wanting. The anthers are always introrse, fixed by the back, bilocular, the
cells nearly parallel and opening longitudinally; they are usually versatile,
but atlnate in Gomplmmlra.

Thiek matted hairs are present in the flowers of many species; along the
middle nerve of the petals on the inside in Ximenia, Lei-etia and Pogopetalzmz3
immediately above the part where the stamens cohere to the petals in most
species of Olaoe and in Srlzoelfiafragrans3 at the top of the filaments in some
Gomplmndrw.

The pistillum is simple and sessile on the t‘or113, which is sometimes thick
and of a glandular texture, but never encircling the ovary or projecting in the
form of distinet glands. The style is simple, terminating either in a thin,
truncate, apparently entire stigmatic surface, or iu a two-, three- or four-lobed,
thick, fleshy stigma.

The ovary is thick and fleshy, containing one, or (in Pogopetalum) three
small eavities, in which are one, two, three or four ovules suspended from the
apex of a placenta which arises from the base of the cavity, and is entirely
free, or more or less connatc with spurious incomplete dissepiments, or with
the side of the ovary next to the style, which is in the latter cases excentrical.
In Ximenia, Ileisteria, Olaoe and Scllcrlfia the placenta is nearly central, bears
three or four ovules, and is more or less connected with as many spurious
dissepiments, which are exceedingly short in the Australian and some East
Indian species ot· Olaoe, but reach nearly to the insertion of the ovules in
other species of Olmr, in Ximenia, and in ›S'rlmqffim In opilia and Cainfjera
the placenta is almost entirely free, and has the appearance of an erect ovule,
but under a strong glass it is seen to bear a single minute ovule suspended from
the apex3 in the young bud, it has appeared to me that there are two ovules
in opilia, three or four in C'cmsjera, a circumstance rendered probable by the
evidently compound nature of the stigma in both genera, but which, on ac-
count of the excessive ininuteness of the parts, I am unable to ascertain with
certainty from ‹lried specimens. After fecundation I never find traces of more
than one ovule.

In lamina, (Gomplzandra ?,) Apodytes and Leretia there are always two ovules
eollaterally suspended, or nearly so, but (in Apodytes, at least), owing to the
lengthened thread by which one of them hangs, they are placed above one
