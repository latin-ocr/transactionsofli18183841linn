Fig. 3. The same figures have the same references. The excavation has now
increased, as is evident by the greater transpareney of the tissue ate.

Fig. 4. The figures refer as before. The viscous tissue at b is now considerably
developed, and of a fine green colom-3 at d, the diseoloured brown
tissue of the apex of the ovar-ium, with the remains of the central
brown line, is visible, and at e, a large excavation‚ occupied chiefly
by dislocated eellular tissue.

Fig. 5. (ι, ἶ), e, d refer as before. The tissue at d, is, however, more blended
with that of the calycine parietes, exeepting its base, which is still
brown. The parietes of the ovarium e, are reduced superiorly to a
great thinness, owing to the development of the albumen at e. f. Is

entirely in the albumen. e. Sulcus along its lower portion, indicating
the original division into two rather unequal cotyledons.

Pige. Same embryo detached. d, e. Have the same references. The coty-
ledons are now adherent by their contiguous faces, although the
sulcus is very evident. f. The basilar portion of the cotyledons
where they do not become adherent. This subsequently forms one
of the lateral slits.

F ig. 9. Nearly mature embryo. a. Its radicular end. b. The cotyledon; the
two being now entirely consolidated except at the basilar point.

There is generally some obliquity about the apices of the cotyle-
dons. The eleft c exists on both sides.
