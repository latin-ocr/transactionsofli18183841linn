7. Ilortlezcm. Spicula? in threcs, l-flowered‚ with thc stalk-like rudimen( ot'

a second floret towards the connnon rachis.

The specics of BRACHYPoDwM have been alternately united with Bromius and
Festum. Kunth joins thenl to Triticum, and I confess I find inore difficulty
in drawing up a character which shall distinguish them froin that genus than
from either of the others. The spiculae are not lnorc. stalked than they are
in the division Jlicropgsrmn, nor perhaps than in 'I'ritirmn ranimmm and in
T. [Vm-(lus the glunies are nearly as uncqnal as in Brarltgspodinm.

‘⁶ Spicula· rachi coutrariae,'’ “Calyx rachcos scrobieulae parallelus,'' “Spiff
culae rachi pa1·allelae‚'' are the terius used by dilt'crcnt botanists to express the
peculiar position of thc spicula² of Lomun. Sinith's calyx of one valve. oppo-
site to the rachis is less obscure, but secius hardly sufficient to indicate the
position of the spicula itself.

Tmrlcum, as it stands now, is a difficult. genus to characterise. Sinith says,
‘⁴ Calyx of two transverse opposite valves, solitary‚ iuany-flowered :” this would
certainly include Bmvhypwliunz, and was probably intended to coinprchcnd
Τ. ἰ()Ιῐιι(-θιω)ι and T. maritimum. There is nothing also to exclude several
other plants whose flowers are sessile on a one-sirleti or two-sided rachis. 'l'hc
word transverse is probably introduced to distinguish it from Lolium, but (locs
not well explain the position of the spiculie. In the longer description of th‹¹
genus he says, “ spikelets lateral, contrary to th«.¹ 1uain stall<.” Kunffl, on the
other hand, says, “spiculae rachi connnuni parallelae.” Sinith adds, that the·
outer palea is keeled or furrowed3 but this is not true of T. (lm-um, nor can it
he well said of T. repens, where neither keel nor furrow is carried (lown to tlw
base, nor are. there either keels οι· furrows to the division silit-rupffrum. IIc
assigns to it a loose seed, but the seed is said to hc attached in T. Spella„
T. monococczzm, T. ‹licocc‘unn and Ι find it to be so also in T. Pon. Iu
T. Nat-(las the valves are unequal; and without the character of cqual valves.
which obtaius through most of the genus, we seem to have no distinction
from Bracltgspodiam. The habit would make inc wish to keep distinct the
four genera Brarlzgspodinm, ,lgr-(tpgyrunz, JIIcmpgsrmn, and Trt'ticum3 but 1
have laboured in vain to find characters On which they might be divided.
The seed is crested in the cultivated wheats, but not. 1 believe, in anv species

of the divisions -·lgropyrzzm and sllicropyrum.
