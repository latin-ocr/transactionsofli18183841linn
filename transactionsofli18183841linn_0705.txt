lWESSRS. lValckenaer and Dufour have separated the „drachmam eonsti-
tnting the order Ammidea into two principal divisions or groups, the former
arachnologist having adopted a differencc in the structure of the mandiblcs.
and the latter a variation in the number of the branchial sacs of those animals.
as the basis of their respective modes of distribution.

M. lValckenaer's first group consists of spiders whose mandibles are arti-
enlated h01·izontally‚ are prominent, and have a vertical inove1nent3 the
species whose mandiblcs are articulated vertically‚ are not prominent, and
have a lateral movement, composing his second group.

The characters supplied by the organic modification on which these groups
are founded appear to be too slight, and of too little importanee in a physio-
logical point of view, to serve for the establislnncnt of divisions of such mag-
nitude3 moreover‚ another objection to the value attached to these characters
by M. lValckenaer arises from the circumstance of their merging gradually
into each other, which prevents a clear line of demarcation being drawn
between them.

An insuperable obstacle also presente itself to the adoption of M. Dufour’s
distribution of the Arsmeidea into spiders with four and spiders with two
branchial sacs; it being impossible to determine, even on dissection, to which
of the two groups numerous speeies belong. Indeed‚ that indefatigahle and
profound naturalist, M. Latressle, in attempting to arrange the Arc-meidea in
accordance with M. Dufour's views, has fallen into the error of separating the
Ariadne insidiatrix of Μ. Savigny (Dysdera insidiatrix, Walck.) from the
