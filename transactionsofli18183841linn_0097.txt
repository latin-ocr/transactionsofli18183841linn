part of the process corresponding to the termination of the curved liness. This
sae consists of a single cell 01· vesicle enclosing many grumous, opake, ovate,
or angular bodies; it has a broad attachment, and is the rudiment of the
ovulum †. Simultaneously the viscous tissue has made its appearance.

As the development proceeds the viscous tissue increases, the sac enlarges
and becomes cellular, and its attachment narrower. It soon assumes a broadly-
obovate form, its attachment becoming at the same time exceedingly narrow.
At this period a vesicle is seen inclosed within the tissue at the commeneement
of its narrow neck ζ. This tissue soon assumes the appearance of albumen.
The viseous tissue is well developed, oceupying the whole of the apex of the
fruit (the prolongation of the eanal remaining isolated in its centre), and
extending to the base of the fruit, to which point it gradually narrows. The
figure of the ovarium has changed, four or five prolongatioris beginning to
appear towards its apex. No change has taken place in the process, and the
two brown curved lines are still visible. Its stalk, as the allnuuinous-looking
ovulum enlargeS, becomes pushed on one side. The ovulum reaches a con*-
siderable development before any change in the embryo occurs. When its
cornua begin to appear, the embryo is globular, cellular, excecdingly minute,
and attached to the nipple later-ally. It is not entirely enclosed, but lodged
in a cavity in the albumeng&

When the fruit is about half developed, the parietes of the ovariurn are in-
durated, and its prolongations are very distinct. The ovulum, which has for
some time assumed the appearance of albumen, and the form of the ovarium,
has 4 or 5 horns corresponding to the prolongations of the former, and as
many obtuse angles. The stalk of the process has become detaehed from the
surrounding tissue, except towards its base, and is pushed considerably to one
side. The apex of the process is slightly elongated and papillose. The embryo
has increased and assumed a more oval form, it has likewise become central,
that is, it occupies the axis of the albumen. As the fruit increases in size,
the embryo becomes unequally emarginate at the apeX, indicating the first
trace of a cotyledonary divisionll . No further changes take place in the other
