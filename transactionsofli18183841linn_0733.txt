rior ones are curved and peetinated, and the inferior one 15 inflected near
its base. The palpi have a eurved, pectinated claw at their extremity.
Abdomen very convex above, projeeting over the base of the cephalo-
thorax; it is thinly covered with long, coarse hah-s, and is variegatcd
with black, red, and white; on the upper part, rather nearer the anterior
than the posterior extreiliity, are two tubercles‚ which arc black in fronh
and pale yellowish white behind; the prevailing tint of the part besor«-
the tubercles is black, and of that behind them, which comprises two
transverse, black streaks connected in the middle, red. Plates of th(¹
spiracles yellow. Sexual organs reddish brown3 a small process con-
nected with their anterior part is directed lmckwards, and on each side
of its extremity is a minute, glossy convexity of a deeper shade.

leerz'dimz callens, which has a close affinity to the Theridion aplzane of
Walckenaer, construets a very remarkable cocoon of a balloon-shape, mea-
suring about {th of an inch in diameter3 it is composed of soft silk of a slight
texture, and a pale hrown colour‚ enclosed in a loose, irregular network of
strong, dark red—brown silk3 several of the lines composing this network art¹
united near the apex of the 6060011, leaving intervals there through which the
young spiders pass when they quit it, and, being agglutinated together through-
out the remainder of their length, form a slender stein, varying from -lssoth to ὲ
of an 111611 111 length, by which the cocoon is attached to the under surface of
stenes and fragments of roek, appearing by its figure and erect position like a
small fungus or some minute production belonging to the vegetable kingdom.
The eggs are very large, considering the small size of the spider, five or six in
number, spherical, not agglutinated together, and are of a brown eolonr. Ι
have not been able to proeure an adult male of this speeies, which frequents

woods in the west of Denbighshire.

Journal of Science, volt iii. pp. 105-6; and Researches in Zoology, pp. 314-15. Subsequently to the
publication of these characters, M. Koch has constituted the genus lilim-yphnntes with species belong-
