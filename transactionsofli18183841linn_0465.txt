the bright and powerful rays of the sun, and while they were daily increasing
in their green 111115, 10 110 covered with a great number of bubbles3 thinking,
however, that they were only air-bubbles escaping from some 1115001, or some
molluscous animal or other, which so frequently lurks within the canals os the
Sponge, Ι carefully chose two or three fresh specimens that were entirely free
from any parasitical animab I placed them in a dish of water, which was
frequently changed, and submitted them to the direct action of the light of
the sun, by allowing the brightest rays to enter through a glass window and
to fall directly upon them ; every day bubbles of gas continued to 110 disen-
gaged from these Sponges, 11111 only 111 any considerable quantity when ex-
posed to the most luminous sunshine. Because plants in the solar light usu--
ally evolve oxygen, which is principally derived from the decomposition of
carbonic aeid gas. I therefore naturally conceived that these bubbles of gas
were most likely mere bubbles ofoxyge11*‚ which are so commonly given 0111
by all plants when put under water and subjected to the same influence of
light, and that they might thus prove, in some measure, confirmatory of my
opinion as to the vegetable nature of this Sponge.

But I must make a more particular statement respecting the currents of
water that have been noticed flowing into and issuing out from the interior of
the Spongilla, and which are analogous to those described by Professor Grant
and other authors, as constantly occurring in the Spongicc Inarime, and
esteemed by them the sti-ongest evidences of their supposed animality. These.
currents Ι have repeatedly observed in most living masses of the River Sponge‚
and have proved their actual presence in various ways. My attention was

³³< Since plants absorb carbonic acid gaS, and exhale oxygen: but, on the contrary, animals absorb
oxygen and give out carbonic aeid gas ; if these bubbles on the application of a proper test werc proved
to be oxygen gas. this would fairly be conclusive of the Spouyillafluviatilis being a plant. Though, on the
other hand, if these bubbles be chemically found nitrogen (azote), this would not decide the present
51100105 to be an animal, because it has been lately shown (by Dr. Daubeny in the Phil. Trans. for
1836, and still more recently by Mr. Rigg in the Phil. Trans. for 1838) that even plants, in certain
stages and under certain circumstances, not unfrequently evolve nitrogen. And if in such case we
can determine by means of chemical tests, that this Sponge actually decomposes carbonic aeid gas
under the influence of solat light, we should then have arrived at a safe conclusion respecting its vege-
tability. Surely similar chemical experiments might be instituted to demonstrate the true nature of
the Marine Sponges. During the time 1 was making the experiments detailed in the text I had no
opportunity of proving these questions.
