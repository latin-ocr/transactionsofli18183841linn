cettes are produced hy the pressure upon them of the cells of parenehyma
among which they lie. They are tough like horn, cannot he torn, craelxle
between the teeth like fragments of caoutchouc, and may he easily eut or
even sheed, when they seem to be pert'ectly homogeueous‚ exhibiting no truce
of layers or successive deposits‚ either when fresh, or after being dried, or
when acted upon hy ordinary chemieal reagents. These nodulcs are mostly
of about the same εἰπε, but here and there some are to bc seen not lai-ger
than the ordinary cells of parenchyma. The latter is thin-sided, in no degree
pitted, and is readily coloured brown hy the aleoholic solution of iodine or
hy exposure to air. Each cell bears with considerable regularity a eytohlast
upon some part of its walls, and in most of the larger cells there is a small
quantity of starch, readily coloured hlue by the aqueous solution of iodiue.
Otherwise the parenehyma contains no solid matter, with the exception ot'
occasional parcels ofacicular raphides.

The nodules are scarcely soluhle in cold water, hut when hoiled they he·
come tumid and partially dissolve into a transparcnt jelly, with a vitreous
lustre. If exposed to the air they rapidly dry and become deep hrown, The
aqueous solution of iodine produces no sensible effect upon them in their na-
tural state; hut if they are first treated with caustic potash, or nitric or sul-
phuric acids, all which dissolve their contents‚ they then acquire a deep claret
colour when acted upon by alcoholic solution of iodine.

But although iodine, in the form of the aqueous solution, while it colours
hlue the grains of stat-ch, produces no sensible effect upon the nodules them-
selves, yet it does produce an effect if the alcoholie solution is employed.
In that case the nodules slowly become amethystine, altering to claret colom· 2
aud if the nodules are wounded, the latter colour gradually, hut slowly, ex-
tends over the wound. These colours, however, soon disappear, especially if
the air is warin ; not a trace of blue is at any time observahle. 'Phe nodules
are therefore not starch. Indeed I believe there is no known instance in
which this common substance possesses even the organic characters which
have been just descrihed3 nor am Ι aware of any other ease of the solid
secretions of plants assuming such an appearance as is found in the subject
of these remarks. The cysts containing oily matter in the riud ot' the Orange
are, in some respects‚ most analogous.
