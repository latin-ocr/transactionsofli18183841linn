IT is well known, that the substance imported from the Levant under the
name of Salep, consists of the pai-boiled tubercles of certain Ophrgsdeous
plants, probably belonging to the genus orchis itself; but while writers are
agreed as to the source of Salep, there is so much difference among them, as
to the nature of the principle it contains, that it has appeared to me desirable
to ascertain whether anatomical cxamination would not decide the question
better than the ordinary methods of chemical investigati0n3 and the result
has justified my expectation.

The following instances of difference in the statements of writers upon
Salep will serve to show how far we yet are from understanding the nature
of this very common substance.

Berzelius says it contains very little gum and starch, but much vegetable
mucus (Pflanzenschleim). Caventou describes it as containing a substance
like Bassorine; that is, a gummy principle differing from gum in being inso-
luble, only swelling up into ajelly, and from all varieties of starch by not
forming a blue compound with iodine.

On the other hand, Guillemin says it is composed ‘⁵ presqu’ entierelnent de
matiere feculante” (Dict. Class. xv. 70.)‚ a statement which 1 quote merely to
show the prevalent opinion of French writers on such subjects; an opinion
which is by no means changed, Guibourt, who, in order to form a correct
idea of Salep‚ examined Orchis roots before they were prepared, declares that
they are composed “d'une grande quantite d'amidon'' 111 grains the size of
wheat starch; and he adds, that this starch is entirely filled by a pulpy mat-
ter, insoluble in cold water, but swelling and dividing very much in hot
