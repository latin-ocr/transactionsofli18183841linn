Ι SHALL take as the type of the evolution of the ovula those of Lot-anthus
,Sl-arrula.

At the earliest stage, that Ι have submitted to exalnination, Ι find that the
ovariuin is intimately adherent with the parietes of the ealyx; its shape being
merely indicated by lines of a denser tissue than the rest. The broadest part
is situated towards the apex of the tube of the calyx. It is hence prolonged
upwards, and terminates by being continuons with the tissue of the base of
the style. It is prolonged likewise downwards into a long subillate process,
which is continuous with the tissue of the pedicle. In the centre of the
broader part a transverse opake line of tissue 15 visible. The tissne eomposing
the calycine parietes is nearly honloge11eous3 nor is there any rudinient
whatever of a viscons formation* If we examine a flower shortly, or even
innnediately, before expansion, we find that 111 addition 10 1110 above, there is
a brown, as it were, sphaeelated line which runs along the eentre of the style
and the upper prolongation of the ovary to the centre of the transverse opake
line; here it is thiekened, and either ceases or spreads transversely on either
side in the direction of the opake 11110. Α1 11115 part there is evidently a small
swelling, and the 1155110 has become more transparent†. These two changes
are owing to the eonnneneement of an excavation formed by the dislocation
of the originally eontinuous tissuc, and which connnnnieates freely with the
eanal apparently existing in the style, along the sphacelated line. Ahnost
shnultaneously with the appearance of this excavation the formation of the
