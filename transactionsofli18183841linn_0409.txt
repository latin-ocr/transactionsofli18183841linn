Prqf. OWEN's Description (gs'tlte Lepidosiren annectens. 343

Its inuscular parietes arc very thick, and are formed, not by what are called
the ζ abdoininal inuscles* in the higher vertebmtes, but. by the laterai series of
oblique inusculai· fasciculi. The proper tunic of the abdomen is a strong
glistening fibrous ine111ln·ane*‚ which is lined by a delicate and transparent
serous ineinbrane†. This 1ne1nbrane is rellccted over the ovariass, which oc-
cupy the sides of the abdominal cavity; and over the liver§‚ stomach, and
intestinell, which are situated between the two ovaria: from the anterior or
under part¹ of the intestine the two laininae of the peritoneum are continued
in a straight line, forming a kind of inediastinuinffl to the opposite parietes ol'
the abdomen, which is thus divided into two lateral conipartinents in the two
posterior thirds of its extent: these coinpartincnts gradually contract poste-
riorly into peritoncal canals, which interconnnunicate by an oval aperture
three lines in length, and have a comnion external outletffiss in front of the
anus††‚ but within the connnon cloacal sphincter. The connnon opening of
the oviductsggjss is behind the anns.

The liiiig's§§ and kidneys are entirely posterior to the peritoneuin.

The intestine is three inches and a half in length, and becomes gradually
contracted to the vent; it is traverscd throughout by a spiral VstlVssllll, which
perforins six gyrations: the extent of intestine traversed by the first turn is
the greatest, measuring above an inch: the second is suddenly shorter, being
about four lines in length: the remaining t'olds 0·1·adually diininish to three
lines in longitudinal extent. The valve terininates by forming a longitudinal
ridge in the narrow rectuinqlffl, which incasures about an inch in length.
The tunics of the intestine arc thick and strong, especially the internal one,
which presents a glandular structure similar to that in the Stin-geon: its sur-
face is, however, proportionally less strongly honeyconibed: it is increased
at the beginning of the intestine principally by spiral linear elevations‚ in the
interspaces of which there is a fine reticulation.

There was no pancreas, nor pancreatic ceeca3 neither could any trace of a
spleen be (letected.

The livet· is a flattened subclongate unilobate gland, situated between the
