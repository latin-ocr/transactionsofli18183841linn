470 sllr. E. J. Qemfflw on the Ergot of Rgse,

the manner iu which they have been conducted, it is considered the body
known as an ergot may bc defined to be a substance compos-ed (f the diseased
ronstiz‘zeents ‹fftlze grain ()c‹·1q)JJng the position ‹3fllie llectllhgs ovary.

Perhaps no vegetable substance has given rise to so many different opi-
nions as to its cause as the Ergot. The earlier investigators supposed it to
be owing to the puncture of an insect‚ and also to excessive inoistn1·e; some
supposed it a habitation for living creatures ; others followed, who considered
it a fungus, which was called Clamosa Clavus by Miinchausen, Selerotium Cla-
rus by DeCandolle, and lastly, Sfiermoedia Clarus by Fries, the sanie view
being also entertained by Philippar. The “ Me'moire sur l'E1·g0t'' by Leveille
certainly approaehes nearer the truth. Ile describes the Ergot as a grain
diseased by a certain fungus, which hc denominates Splzacelia, and assigns to
it the characters given below& still this intelligent observeris in error when he
supposes that the appendage at the apex of the ergot is one of the conditions of
the fungus, instead of being coniposed of the remains of the periearp and hairs
belonging to it, together occasionally with the reinains of the styles; or, to
use his own words, “Si ce chanipignon traverse les gluines saus eprouver
d'accident on le voit a l'extreniite. de Fergot, ou il fornie un tubercule jaune
dont la consistance‚ le volume et la figure sont extreineinent variables.’'

Phoebus, the latest authority, considers the ergot to be the albumen altered
‘⁴ wir diirfen sie [Mutterkorn]'' also “ wohl fiir ein alienertes Eiweiss halten'‘
(p. lO4)‚and consequently to be a morbid grain of rye (p. 105), but denies that
the “Blaschffls' can be sporidia of a fungus, since they are of variable size
and contain other Slnaller bodies.

Fron} the foregoing observations it must be evidcnt that the nature of an er-
got is beeoining better understood, from its origin being relieved of some of thc

obscurity that has hitherto enveloped it; therefore the former received opinions
