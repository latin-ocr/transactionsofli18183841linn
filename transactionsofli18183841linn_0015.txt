Ι. Observations on the Genera ofEuropean Grasses. By JOSEPH U'ooos, Esq-‚
F.L.S.

Read February 215t, and April 4th, 1837.

IT has often been observed, that where a great number of plants is united in
a very natural class it is difficult to distinguish the genera, and that where the
genera are natural it is often hardly possible to discriminate the species. Both
these difficulties occur among the grasses. Forming in themselves a very
closely allied group, they are hardly to be separated into genera, whieh, pos-
sessing a still greater similarity among themselves, shall preserve a distinction
of habit and appearance from the rest3 and it is not even easy to find artificial
characters which shall distingnish a group‚ however formed, from the rest
of the tribe, nor in many cases a single species from those most nearly allied
to it.

My business at present is, however, with the Genera: and with such genera
only as occur within the limits of a projeeted work on the botany of the most
frequented parts of Europe3 that is to say, of the British Islands, France, the
Low (enutries, Gemuany, Sivitzerland, and Italy. My knowledge of these
genera was so nuper-feet, that it seemed impossible to proceed without entering·
into a pretty minute examination of them, and the result of this examination
I now offer to the Linnean Society.
