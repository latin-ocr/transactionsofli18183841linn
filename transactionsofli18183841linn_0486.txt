410 Mr. Wss‘rwoon's Illztstrations of tlte

The truly comparative nature of these relations has not been hitherto stated,
and hence, as it appears to me, has originated much of the niisconeeption
which still exists even among professed natm-ansts, many of whom are
ready to admit the existence of relations amongst natural objeets founded
upon more or less complete resemblances, but yet of equivalent value, without
perceiving the various natures, and consequently varied vallic, of such rela-

tions *.
In the following pages I have first selected such speeies of insects as exhibit
an analogy with other speeies of the same order; and secondly, such as illus-

trate the analogies between insects of different orders.

That species belonging to two genera of the same family, or even subfamily,
may be analogous representatives of each other, is as clear as though they
belonged to different families or orders, Thus, although the genus Adelium, K.
is so excellent an example of analogy, when its species are compared with the
species composing the family Caraln'dw, that the specific names Cat—almicles,
C'alosonzohlm, Licinnides, have been given to insects belonging to the former
genus, yet there may be relations of analogy existing among the speeies of

³¹< One of the chief difficulties connected with this subject is that of drawing the precise line between
these two kinds of relations (hence the difficulties connected with the true location of Mantispa) ; this
is not a little increased by the evident distinctions existiug amongst each class of relations ; thus affi-
nities may be so concealed as to escape the eye even os professed naturalists; hence thc Homopterous
genus Aleyrodes so completely puts on the appearance of a moth, that Linnzeus named it lelaena
Tinea proletella ; whilst Fabricius in all his works described an Orthopterous insect (Hymenoles rlzombeu,
&Vestem Proc. Zool. Soc, 1837, p. 130.) under the Homopterous genus fisembracis; the precise relations
of these insects being {lisyzzised affinities. The relation between the house· and field-cricket is an criden!
affinity, but that which exists between the field-cricket and the niole-ericketis a disyzzisrd affinity, and
yet no one will question the propriety of these insects being considered as closely allied together, al-
though so totally different in form. Again, analogics may be equally disquisecl. No one, for example,
has ever supposed that one of the Carabidae and Panssus possessed any relation ; and yet not only do
Ourna and szsszts erepitatc, but both also possess a minute tubercle at the posterior external angle
of the elytra‚ which no other Coleopterous insects cxhibit. In like manner, no one would suppose
that any relation could exist between a butterfly and a woodlouse (beyond that of each being a Con-
(lylopodous animal), aud yet by comparing the imperfect state of Thecla with the perfect state of Ouis-
[ηις we find them to possess a disquisecl analoqical relation. I mention these as instances of the many
trivial circumstances which may be collected as grounds for asserting the existence of analogical re-
lations, which are necessarily often of so diversified a character and so readily to be traecd between
almost any given groups, as to lead to a supposition that they can afford no decisivo test of a natural

arrangement independent of more important considerations.
