452 Mr. SMITfl's Observations oni the Causa> of Ergot.

Ι had not the opportunity of examining the rye in a young state, but have
found the oblong bodies on old rye ergots.

Nota—It is right for 1116 to state, that when these observations were written
1 was not aware that much of what Ι have mentioned had already been noticed
hy earlier writers ; for I find that so long ago as 1783, Tessier speaks of having
seen the fluid hanging in drops from ergot-bearing spikes, and several snc-
‹Jeeding observers notice the oblong bodies contained in the fluid, and which
were by them considered as the sporules 01· seeds of the ergot, But the
nearest approach to the correct view of the subject is given in the Trans-
actions of the Linnean Society of Paris for 1826, by Leveille, whose account
differs but little from my observations. Leveille is the first who distinctly
states the oblong bodies (which are found accompanying the ergot) to be the
seeds of a very minute fungus, to which he gives the very appropriate name
Splzacelia segetum ; and which fungus he regards as the cause of Ergot.

'l'he question now is, 111 what way the ovarium becomes infected with this
fungus so as to cause it to become an ergot? And although my observations
(since my original paper was written) do not yet enable me to speak with cer-
tainty on this point,—yet, on viewing all circumstances, I am still induced to
consider Ergot to be a constitutional disease of the plant, brought about by
the reproductive matter of the fungus being absorbcd during germination, and
carried up by the fluids of the plant, and becoming (leveloped in the fructifica-
tion even before the opening of the floral envelopes‚—but whether the ovarium
is at this time infected with the disease, or whether it is communicated to it

during impregnation from the already diseased anther, is a question still to be
solved.
