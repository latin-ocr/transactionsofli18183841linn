Differs from the European plant only by having the faces of the fruit
usually concave.

In this plant the usual joint in the pedicels is placed quite close to the
flower3 in P. dumetorum the joint is very near the base of thc pcdiccl, i. c.
the base of the flower is prolonged so as apparently to form the greater part
of the footstalk; in P. pter-occupant the joint is placed at about the middle.
