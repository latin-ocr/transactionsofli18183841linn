68⁴2 Mr. BENTHAM'S Accozmt of two new Genera allied to Olacineae.

have thought it more convenient to keep them together under the general
character above given. Those species of Olaoe in which the dissepiments of
the ovary are almost obliterated form the connexion with Opiliece, and, as far
as known to me, Gomplzandra appears to join Opiliece with Icacinece, whilst
Pogopetalum is in many respects equally allied to Olacete and Icacineoe.

The first tribe, where the double nature of the floral envelopes is most evi-
dent and complete, is that which comes nearest to the various polypetalous
orders, with which Olacinece have been compared. But among these, I can-
not admit the affinity to Ant-antiacese. The structure of the seed, where
it is so constantly and materially different as in these two orders, becomes
one of the most important characters in the classification of Dicotyledons;
and it is here accompanied by considerable differences in the fruit, in the
ovary, in the aestivation of the corolla, in the texture of the vegetable organs,
and other points of habit. And those peculiarities, in which Aurantiaceoe
appear to resemble Olacinew, such as the tendency of the petals to cohere by
means of the stamens, the persistent calyX, &c.‚ occur in other orders which
are less removed by essential characters.

llleliacece, nearly allied to Am—(mtiaceoe, are about equally distant from
Olacineoe in essential characters, and more so in habit.

Humiriaeeoe, a small order usually associated with Illeliacere and :iurantia-
σθω, differ from them in habit, in the ovary, the fruit and the seed; in all of
which points they approach much to Olacineoe. The dissepiments of the ovary
are, when young, not quite complete, and the embryo lies in the axis of a
copious albumen. They differ chiefly from Olacinew in the aestivation of the
corolla, which is not so decidedly valvate, in the stamens often indefinite in
number, in the dilatations of the connectivum of the anther, the presence of a
disc round the ovary, the fruit more generally plurilocular, and the larger
embryo with a long 1·adicle; but, upon the whole, they are probably, among
dichlamydeous plants, those which come nearest to Olacinece.

styracem& which are perhaps more allied to polypetalous orders than to
those which are essentially gamopetalous, are very near also to Hieme-iacere as
well as to Olacinew. The structure of the fruit and seeds may indeed be
compared to those of Sclzoelgfim that of the ovary in some respects to Pogope-
