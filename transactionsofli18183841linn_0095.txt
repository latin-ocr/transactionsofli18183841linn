the Orula qsLoranthus and Viscum. 73

The fully developed embryo is oblong‚ clavate, the radit-le forming the
thickest part; there is a slight narrowing about the junction of the cotyle-
dons with the radicle. In the eentre of this part two oblong foveolae or sulci
are observable, which owe their existence to the non-union of the bases of the
cotyledonff. The plnmula is small, bnt totally concealed, 11111055 indeed the
cotyledons are eut away. The embryo is attached very slightly by a very fine
short membrane, the originally long funiculus having disappeared. This dis-
appcarance is, I imagine, not real; probably the tissuc of the funiculus contri-
1111105 to the formation of the embryo. The coloration of the embryo keeps
pace with its development. Throughout its first stages it. is eolourless3 the
green colour is first visible about the time that the division of the cotyledons
appears, and it. continues increasing as the embryo approachcs nearer and
nearer to a state of perfection.

At this time it is entirely green, the colour differing however in tint; the
radicle, particularly towards its apex, being tinged with yellow. The greatest
development of green is at the base of the cotyledon, about the sulci or clefts.

With respect to the changes that have taken place at the time of maturity
of the fruit 111 1110 calyx and ovarium, Ι 1111151 mention the total disappearanee
of green viscous 1155110. The whole cellular substance between the outer
layer, 01· 01111010 of the calyx and the ovarium, is converted into a yellowish
transparent viscous matter. This is not, however, prolonged down the stalk
of the ovarium, which is now fibrous†. With respect to the ovarinni, the only
remarkable circumstance is the softening down and conversion of a portion ot'
its texture, particularly towards its apex, into viscous tissue. This often occurs
to such a degree that the naked radicle is imbedded in the viscous tissue, and
is no doubt intended to remove any impediinent to the occurrence of germi-
nation.

In two or three other species that Ι have examined the same phenomena
occur; but in these there was no development of green viscous matter, nor
any colouring of the albumen. In 0110 species the cotyledons were consoli-
dated, and two natural clefts existed3 in the other, they were merely applied
face to face, consequently no clefts were present or necessary. But inde-
pendent of these, and of changes of form dependent on speeific difference, l
