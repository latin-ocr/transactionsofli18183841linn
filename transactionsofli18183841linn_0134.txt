κίρνη erect5 lmrbaceous, smootli ; in some specimens slightly downy below the
joints, the internodes very long. Lem-es ovate or ovate-oblong, their
bases cordate and amplexicauL sometimes shortly stalked‚ nari-owing
gradually into a long sharp point, often quite smooth on both sides,
sometimes with the nervos, particularly upon the under side, minutely
pubescent¹ ; the margin costate-crenatc and more or less revolute. *S'tipules
very long, entire, glabrous, blunt. Fam-ers rather large, in long slender
solitary or twin spikes, with very long pedicels jointed just below the
flowcrz the bractere broad, imbricateth pointed, the point often very

long3 the sepals ovate-‹Jblsmg Fruit 3-quetrous, the faces ovate and

pointed, smootli and shining.

After the examination of numerous specimens 1 have come to the conclusion
that P. ambignum and P. myspltgsllum of Prof. Meisner cannot be considered
as even marked varieties‚ but form only accidental forms of one species, pro-
bably caused by a (lifference of soil and situation. Prof. Don informs me that
tliis species is P. mnplemicaule, and also P. petiolatzmz of his Prod. Fl. Nepai.
I bave therefore restored the former name.
