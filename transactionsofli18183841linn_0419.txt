be confessed that the physiological ‹·onsequenees of the modifications of the
nasal eavity above alluded to would have been far too insignitieant 111 hare
established the ichthyic nature of the Lepidosl'ren, if, with coexisting gills and
lungs, the modifications of the other organie systexns 111111 agreed with those ot'
the Perennibranehians instead of with those of Fishes. For although it be true
that the fish-like modification of any single system is 1050111010οῐ of itself 11)
determine the removal of the Lepidos-iren from the Amplzilm, in which it has
hitherto been placed, 10 the class of Fishes, yet it is impossible to avoid ar-
riving at that conclusion, when we consider the concurrence of iehthyic 01111-
racters in so many parts of the organization of this most interesting species.
The combination of cycloid 5011105, 01000115 110015, quasi—rins supported each
by a many-jointed ray, a gelatino-cartilaginous vertebral style united to the
whole surfaee of the basi-occipital and not to two basilar eondyles, the prae-
opereular bone, the simple structure of the lower Jaw‚ the double spines of
the 0001·- 111111 litem-apophyses, the green colour of the ossified parts of the.
skeleton 3—these external and osteological characters being associated with an
intestinal spiral valve, with the absence of panereas and spleen, the position of
the anus anterior to the allantoid bladder, a clicoelous heart‚ six pairs of bran-
chial arches with the gills eoneealed, the simple organ of hearing consisting
only of the acoustic labyrinth excavated in cartilage and provided with large
otolithes, and, lastly, the blind 0115111 sacs,—form a cumulative body of evi-
dence 111 proof that the Lepidosiren is a Fish, which far outweighs the
argument to the contrary, founded on the reptile-like development of its air-
bladder‚ 11011 115 conversion into an organ of a'erial respiration.

The weight of this argument is, in fact, very much (11011111511011 by the close
approximation which certain of the abdominal Fishes, called ‘Sauroid' by
M. Agassiz, make to the Lepidosiren in the lang-like structure of the air-
bladder. In the Freshwater Amin Cuvier states that its swim-bladder is 115
cellular as the lung of a 1100111οὴ and this genus also agrees with the Lepi-
dosiren in the absence of pyloric caeeal appendages. In the genus Lepidos-teas,
again, Cuvier describes the air-bladder as being as 001101111- as in the Amin.
and occupying the whole length of the abdomen†.
