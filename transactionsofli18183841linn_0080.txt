nucleus at some period previous to fecundation‚ and which, at least in its
earlier stages of development, is the only eoat that is membraneus. If this
view be correct, the anomalies will be reduced to the formation of the albu-
men, or rather, tissue of the amnios and embryo exterually to the nucleus, and
to the application of the male 1011110000 10 1110 apex of the sac of the amnios
instead of to that of the nucleus.

This seems to me to be the best explanation of this anomalous development,
although there is 110 appreciable reason why such an extraordinary modification
should be adopted. The mode of development has some analogy to that of
Lorantltzcs and l'iscmn, with which it agrees 111 especial in the albumen being
destitute of a proper integument. Ι may, perhaps, be borne 0111 111 giving it
as niy opinion that sztalum forms the connecting link between the simplest
form of ovulum, as exemplified by Lnrantltus and Viscum, and the ordinary
and more eomplicated form of these organs. Another mode of explanation is
obvious, by adopting which the male influence would 110 supposed to operate
on the usual spot, viz, the apex of the nucleus3 but as the anatorny of these
parts does not confirm the supposifflon, and as the number of anomalics are
not reducible to such an extent by this as by the explanation adopted above,
I prefer the opinion that the ovula are reduced to nuclei, and that the ‘⁶ seed''
of botanists is developed externally to this, and 00051515 of, or is reduced to a
naked albumen and an ordinary cmbryo.

Ι shall not enlarge ou the changes that take place after the supposed action
of the male influence until at a subsequcnt period Ι 1111νο demonstrated the
continuity of the filaments with the grains of pollen adhering to the stig-
mata. The fitness of the present subject for attempting to ascertain rigorously
what the first changes incident on this action actually are, 15 111 once very
obvious, and close examination will probably put us in possession of very im-
lnjrnrnt results.
