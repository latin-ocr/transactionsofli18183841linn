three-sided‚ with their broadest flattened surface turned foi-wards and covered
by the peritoneum. The ureter* runs along their posterior and outer edge,
and opens into the common termination of the oviducts. The kidueys are
surrounded by a capsule of ccllular membrano, beneath which there is a
quantity of intense blaek pigment: the same pigment is developed from the
meinbrane surrounding the oviduets above the kidueys. There is a small Ai-

lantoid bladder†.

The ovariass are compressed bodies between four and five inehes in length,
situated‚ as above described, at the sides of the abdominal cavity; having a
proper capsule bencath the serous investment‚ and with their posterior extre-
mities continued a little way beyond the posterior line of reflection of the
peritoneum. Thc ovisacs exhibited different stages of development: those on
the posterior part of the ovarium were lai-ger than those on the anterior. The
larger ova are from one line to two lines in diameter3 these were scattered
throughout the whole length ofovary, and were separated by clusters of smaller
ovisacs varying in size from one twentieth osan inch to invisible minuteness.
The oviduetsx} are long, tortu011S‚ and commence each by a distinct aperture
at their anterior part, which is in the form of a slit, about three lines in length ll.
The oviduct is closely attached throughout the greater part of its course to
the outside of the capsula ovarii: its tunics gradually increase in thickness as
it approaches the cloaca, but are nowhere complicated with a special glandu-
lar apparatus. The internal sui-face of the lower third of the oviduet presents
small parallel oblique laminae, like those in the uterus of the Shark. The two
oviducts unite and form one strong muscular crinal between the allantois and
the ureters; and after receiving the eontents of these parts, the common eanal
terminates in the posterior part of the cloaca.

Thus the female organs of geneiation in the Lepidos-iren, both as regards
the condition of the ovaria, caused by the partial or successive development ot'
the ova, and the freedom of the oviduct, present a grade of development as
high as that. which characterizes the Plagiostomous Fishes ; while the elongated
