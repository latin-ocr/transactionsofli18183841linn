Nutu—Since the preceding account was read before the Society‚ I have.
been favoured by ΜΓ. Burchell with flowcring speciinens of two species of his
remarkable genus leigmwm namely R. spinoswn and obovatmn, and by Mr.
Bentham with a specimen of the latter species, with two separate fruit. These
plantis agree well with the present in habit, but the calyx 15 short, wide, and
campanulate, with an equa] 111111), neither cloven, nor spathaceous; the corolla
bas a very short tube, much narrower than the calyx, with the faux much di-
lated, ventricosc, and campanulate3 the 51111116115 are unequal in length, two
of them being longer than the rest. The margin of the leaves in all the spe-
eies of Rlzigozum hitherto known is perfectly entire. From these differences,
therefore, it is evident that Catoplzractes must either constitute a distinct ge-

transition from that genus to the pentandrous simple-leaved Spathodeoe.
