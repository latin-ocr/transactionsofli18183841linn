oftlze Gigans of Pilularia globulifera. 493

the Sporules of szgermannia complanata exhibit similar lines after they have
been sulnnitted to the aetion of sulphuric aeid. After the protrusion of the
gei-111, however, it does appear to he quite innnaterial from what part of the
germ ‘the first leaves, root or stein shall arise.

It is almost. superfluous to point out, that these primordial leaves, if the.
sporules be considered as secus, have no analogy, except iu their use, with
cotyledons, because true cotyledons pre-exist in the seed, whereas these are
the product of gerinination. But according to the view of the nature of
sporules which I have endeavoured to establish‚ Pilalaria must he considered
as nearly allied to inonoeotyledons in its germination. In cotyledonous plants
the first steps of germination (under which terni Ι include the growth of the
mature pollen) are protected hy a distinct apparatus (the seed-eoats) fur-
nished for that purpose; and in inonocotyledonous plants a single primordial
leaf and root are developed in a sheath‚ through which they burst in the pr«)-
gress of gerinination. Now Piluluria differs from this simply in not having
the first stages of its germination protected by a separate apparatus, unless,
indeed, the conical meinhranes which sorni the external cavity (Tin. XXXIV.
fig. 6.) at the germinating end of the sporule are to he considered as the [nost
rudimentary state of the female organ3 for, as in monocotyledons, the cellular
mass arranges itsclf into a sheath, which incloses the rudiment of a leaf and
root, and the ainylaceous (ἓ) partie-les and grumous fluid, which fill the cavity
of the sporule, fulfil the same office as the albumen of monocotyledons. I shall
conclude these. observations hy stating that I have not been able to detect
any organs which, as in the Mosses, can by any possibility be supposed to
perform the office of impregnating the sporules.
