Read December 18111, 1838; and June 4th, 18:39.

AS l had an opportunity during this last summer of making additional
researehes on the River Sponge, 1 think it necessary to lay before the Lin-
nean Society some further observations relating to that substance, in order
10 correct, to elucidate, and to confirm several passages in my former letter,
and likewise to add a few remarks upon the nature of the Sea Sponges.

In the first place, I ought 10 mention to you that Ι was not aware, until
some time after my last comnnmication had been submittet] to the Society,
that there are other eminent naturalists, besides Dr. George Johnston, who at
this day advocate the vegetable nature of all Sponges; and these I understand
are, Dr. H. F. Link, Professor of Botany at Berlin; Dr. J. Mfiller, Professor
of Anatomy at Berlin 3 and Mr. J. E. Gray, of the British Museum. Of whom
the several opinions may be examines] in the following works: Transactions
of the Royal Aeademy of Sciences at Berlin for the year 1830, Berlin, 1832,
p. 109. ‘⁶ Uber die Pflanzenthiere uberhaupt und (lie dazu gerechneten Ge-
wasehse besonders,” von Hrn Link. “Annales des Scienees Naturelles, Seconde
Serie‚ tom. ii. Romaque? Paris, 1834, p. 328. “ Sur les Zoophytes en general
et en particulier sur certaines Plantes qn'on a eonfondues avec eux‚'' par
H. F. Link; being a translation of part of the former memoir. Miiller's
“ Elements of Physiology‚'' translated by Dr. BaIy, Lond. 1838, vol. i. p. 42.

belongs to the vegetable kingdoln3 in proof of which, the facts and arguments
