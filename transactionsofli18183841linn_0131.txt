MY friend Professor Royle having done me the honour to submit to my ex-
amination and description those species of P11(1sgo›11c7›z and Htgnplzsrum which are
contained in his extensive Indian Hel-barium, Ι have now the pleasure of com-
municating the result to the Linnean Society. After the valuable monograph
by Professor Meisner upon the lVallichian Polygoneae, published in the third
volume of the Plantw Asiatica) rariores, it was not to be expected that many
new species would occur in this collection. I was therefore. the more pleased
by finding not fewer than ten totally distinct forms amongst the natives of
the Hinialayan mountains and the upper provinces of India. Ι would parti-
cularly direct attention to the tribe Amic-alarin, in which Dr. Wallich's herba-
rium is peculial-ly deficient. Meisner describes four specics, all of them very
closely allied to P. aniculare, Lina„ only one of which occurs in this collection,
but the other three are replaced by five most interesting plants‚ only one of
which appears to have been previously noticed.

In all cases in which Ι have been able to identify my plants with those of
Professor Meisner, Ι have adopted his specific characters, but have always
drawn my detailed descriptions from the Roylean specimens which Ι had before
me. My friend, Professor Don, has most kindly given me his valuable. assist-
ance, and has added much to the value of this paper by identifying several of
Meisner's species with those described by him in his Prod. Fl. Nepalensis.

As this family has been so recently illustrated in the Pl. Asiat. Rar„ I have
