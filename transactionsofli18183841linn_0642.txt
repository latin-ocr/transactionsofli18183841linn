marsseS, according with the description given of that of Dictisostega. Thai
portion of the ovarium invcstcd by part of the perianthium is osan oblong-
shape, tapcring at its base, and of a deep reddish-purple colour, hut the
upper portion is free, of a pale colom, and tapers upwards in the form
of a sharp cone, from the summit of which rises the ercet filiform style-
which attains the height of the Stamene, and then divides into three very
divaricate, sigmoid stigmata, each of which forms at its extremity a some-
what upright funnelvshapcd cup, with an oval orifice, drawn together ou
the two sides, and filled with a yellowish viscid fluid. The capsule very
much resembles that of Dic-(istmtega, hut the sceds are different: they arc
ohlong, quite ορ11116, of a yellowish-hrown eolour, and suspended by a slen-
der umhilical cord. The. testa is marked with very prominent reticulations.
appearing by a common lens as if covered with twisted longitudinal la-
mellae; but under a higher power it is seen to consist. of elongated, hexa-
gonal cells.

The plant was found by me in the Organ Mountains> in March 1838, in a
swainpy situation under the shade of a large block of granite.

I cannot close the enumeration of these plants without. alluding to the two
species regarded by some as distinct from Bia-mmmm under the name of Tri-
pterella3 the one is Tripterella capitata of Miehaux, which Von Martius con-
siders to he the same as his Brazilian Burmannia capitata ; but judging from
the specimen in the Herbarium of the Eritish Museum, I am inclined to
believe they are two distinct species: the other is Tripterella can-alea of
Elliott and Numan, which is the same as Bia-mannia bg'fida of Linnaeus. It.
is chiefly on the authority of M1·.Nuttall that 'I'ripterella has been retained
distinct from Bai-mannis& hut as I cannot find that he has offered any evi-
dence of an existing difference, there seems no good ground for this sepa-
ration.

From the facts now adduced‚ we find that the Bia-manniaceoe comprise two
very distinct groups of plante, namely, those having a trilocular ovarium with
eentral placentation, and those having a unilocular ovarium with parietal pla-
eentation. The first consists only of the two genera, Rarmannia and Gony-
anthes ; the second contains four genera, viz. Dictgsostega, [symbocm-pa, Apteria
and Gymnosiphon: that they are all very closely related there cannot be any⁷
