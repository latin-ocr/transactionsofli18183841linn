310 Per. DoN's Descriptions of the Indian Species of Iris.

group, which is principally confined to Asia and America, is distinguished by
having the spathes frequently leafy, a tube continuous with the ovarium, and
often very short; by their heardless sepals3 and by the petals being smaller
and spreading. The speeies of this group produce their flowers generally later
in the season: a circumstance which, together with their being chiefly inha-
bitants of a drier elimate, renders the protection of the petals less necessary.
Our own Flora affords two cxamples of this Section in It·isfieticlissima and
Psemlacoras. The very cau-ly period ot' flowcring of the Iris fcetidissima may
be supposed to affin-d a strong objectum to the theory as to the use of the con-
ver-gent petals in the first group of the genus; hut the plant is well known to
occur only in sheltered situations, where a considerable degree of protection
is afforded to the ssowers. Of the five Indian species, which I shall now pro-
ceed to describe, two belong to the first gmup, and three to the second.
