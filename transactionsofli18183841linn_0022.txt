8 Mr. W oons on the Genera of European Grasses.

from a general sense of comparative similarity, no two botanists would per-
haps exactly agree. Thus Art-ll(waltherum, placed by Linnaeus among the
Aeenoe, and declared by SirJ. E.Sinith to be an ‚It-emt in habit, is transferred
by many botanists to IIolcus. De Candolle, or at least Duby, in a work to
which De Candolle's approbation is attached, and to which his name is added,
solves the difficulty by putting Hulwa- and A-Ivena into one genus. But ac—
cording to Kunth, Imeus does not belong to the Areum-ew but to the Phala-
ri‹l‹¹w; and as the barren flower of :hv-hemaherum is the lowest, this genus
would belong technically to the second section of Brown, while both Holeas
and Arena belong to the first3 and Kunth, though he places Halous with the
Pl111l111·i‹lew,yet fixes ⁴Irrlzemttherum, in spite os its outer barren floret, among
the ,Ji-emacem. In these indeterminate problems, ifI may use the expression,
no individual can be very confident that he is in the right, but the question
in each particular case will at last be determined hythe adherence of the men
of the clearest and most comprehensive views, and who have most carefully
studied the subject. At present, in the grouping of Grasses, we seem to stand
but on the threshold3 and while one distinguished botanist invites us in one
‹lirection and another in another, the bewildercd student is at a loss which to
pursue.

Reichenbach, though he has distributed his Grasses into tribes, has pro-
bably given his attention more to the determination of species than to the
arrangement of genera. IIiS groups are nearly the same as those of Kunth,
and the variations which he has introduced are not for the better.

1 mention Kuntb last, as it is his grouping which I propose nearly to adopt
as to the natural arrangement of the genera3 and Ι begin with this part of the
subject, because it is the careful consideration of natural affinitics which must
guido us in the ehoiee of the characters= on which each genus is to be esta-
blished.

This author, in the work to which I have already referred, divides the
(nasses into 153 tribes, which, however, he hardly attempts to characterizc.
I-lc gives no explanation of the motives which induced him to put plants into
the Same tribe, or to ¹<epar-ate them into different ones: nor is it easy to cx-
tract such 1110tives from the short and loose description which he has prefixed

to each tribe, and which, short and imperfect as it is, is generally contradicted
