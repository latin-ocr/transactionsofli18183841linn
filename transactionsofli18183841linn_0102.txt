occasionally reciproeally united hy “suekers ;'' in such there is actual com-
munication between the ligneous sy⁷ste111s*.

With respect to the parts on which the parasitism oecurs, J believe it is
entirely dependent on the permanenee of their nature. I have met with a
solitary instance of the attachment and evolution of Lorcmllms on the leaf of
a Guttiferous trec. The plant had reached the height of two inehes, and had
developed several leaves; no lateral shoot had been sent out. Its base was
expanded on the upper surfaee of the leaf, and the sucker-like root. had pene-
trated the cutiele, and was firmly imbedded in the parenehymatous mesophyl-
lum. Although in all probability this plant would, had it been left to its own
fate, have perished, yet it might have become, before this had taken place,
attached by a latei-al shoot to a part capable of sustaining it by its permanent
nature. I am also of opinion that attachment will take place on any plant†,
or part of a plant, the duration of which is sufficiently long. Those with
milky juice, though perhaps a general, are not an universal exception.

I have met with a speeies fiourishing on the Artorarpus integi-{solim The
juiee of this specics was not lnilky3 it is hence obvious that they have an
eliminating power, although the faet stated by De Candolle‡ of coloured fluids
passing into their tissne through the stock would lead us to suppose other-
wisc.

With respect to the bourrelets formed round each attachment, they are
occasioned by the deposit of new wood round their basem they are often
irregular, the upper part being, as might be expected, somewhat more de-
veloped.

Ι have never seen any seeondary roots sent off either into the interior of the
wood, or between the bark and woodgK.

lt will be interesting to compare this with grafts, on which subject Ι am quite ignorant. Ι think
the attachment of Loramlltus is not analogous to grafts.

ξ 1 have before mentioned that in one species of Viscum both primary and secondary e.1·!er1ml at-
tachments take place. A slight examination of another speeies, in which no lateral shoot had been
developed, leads me to suspect that the mode of adhesion of Viscum albam is not thoroughly under-
stmuh and that the appearance of roots running between the bark and wood of the stoek is, perhaps„

attributable to a peculias modification of the wood of the latter. whatever the cause may be with
