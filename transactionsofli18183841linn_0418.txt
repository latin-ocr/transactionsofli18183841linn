character would of itself have been totally inadequate 10 determine the classific
characters of a doubtful species: it is only 111 conjunction with other modi-
fications of structure that it assists 111 our present attempt to determine the
true affinities of the Lepidosiren.

As regards the principal conditions of the organs of generatim, the line of
dcmarcation cannot 110 drawn between the „hnplzihia and the Plagiostomous

shows its near affinity to the Reptsscs, by no means proves that it. is not a Fish.

The hrain of the Lepidosiren like 115 generative system indiCates its close
relationship as a Fish with the Amphibia, but nothing more.

The optic ncrves do not decussate, hut come off from nearly the same point
111 front of the infimdihulum: since, however, the same structure exists in the
Sharks and Rays, this likewisc fails to establish the amphibious character of
the Le‘phlosiren.

On the other 11111111, 1110 simple condition of the organ of hearing, consist-
ing merely of the lahyrinth without a cochlea, or a fenestra rotunda, might
be taken as proof of the ichthyic nature of the Lepidos-iren: the organ of
hearing, however, presents‚as is well known, a similar simple condition in the
Perennibranchiate Reptilcs.

In the organ of smcll we have, at last, 11 character which is absolute in
reference to the distinction of Fishcs from Reptiles. Ι11 every Fish it 15 a
shut sac communicating only with the external snrt'ace; 111 every Reptile it is
a canal with both an external and an intcrnal opening.

According to this test, the Lepidosiren 15 a Fish : by its 11050 11 15 known not

at 1110 01050 of our analysis we arrive at this very unexpected result, that a
Reptile is not characterized by its lungs nor a Fish by its gius, but that the
only unexceptionable distinction is atl'orded by the organ of smell.

The anatomieal facts already detailed fully justify this emphatic sunnnary
