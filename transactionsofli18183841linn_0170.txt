pendently of the express declaration of its discoverer, that it had no pouch,
though he had no recollection of the characters of the 166111, I beg leave, in
the meantime, to offer the following reasons in support of my belief that it is
a true Jerboa. In 1116 first place, the form of the head, the swollen muzzle55
cover-td with hair, and projecting considerably beyond the short under-jaw,
are well-known characters of the leentia, which are not common to the
Saltigrade Marsupials3 in which, more especially among the smaller sized
species, the head is attenuated and flattened sidewavs, the 6111160111)Υ of the
muzzle naked, and the under-jaw nearly of the same length as the upper.
Secondly, the character of the tail, naked and scaly throughout the greater
part of its length, and terminated by a large pencil of long hair, 15 unknown
among the Saltigi-ade Μαι-5111111115, 111111 universal among the Jerboas. 'shirdlyz
the three middle 1065 ot· the hind feet are of the same sizo, and originate on
the same line, a structure likewise characteristic of the ‚len-boas, whilst the
Sahigrade Maisupials, 1111 1116 contrary, have the latcral 11165 placed consider-
ably behind the middle, and of much smaller size. Fourfflly, there is ne
known instance of a Saltigrade Marsupial with an additional or accessory toe.
placed half—way up the tarsus, as represented in the figure of Dilms Jlitclzellii,
though the character is common enough among 1116 Jerboas; and lastly‚ there
is no known instance of a Saltigrade. Marsupial which llas not the two internal
1065 of the hind feet united, orosa Rodent that llas. In this last character, as
in all the rest, the drawing of Μίμας Min-hellii perfectly agrees with the true
Jerboas, and differs from the Saltigmde Marsupials 3 so that if it erentually turn
out to belong to this latter family, it must possess the characters of an 655611-
111111)ν new form, of a genus no less singular than novel. It may be observed,
111 conclusion, that the fidelity of 1116 figure is unquestionable3 Major Mitchell
is well known to be a skilful (lraughtsman3 he made his sketch upon the spot.
when 1116 animal was captured ς 111111 1101 being himself a zoologist‚ it 15 utterly
impossible that he could have so accurately depicted 1116 characters of the
genus Dipzcs.r of which he had perhaps never heard, had henot drawn from
the model.
