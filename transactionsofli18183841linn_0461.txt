Circulation of the Char-aff ‘⁶ Uber die Anatomie und den Kreislauf der Cha-
ren.” Thus do these granulcs afford additional analogy in their spontaneous
movelnents to the sporules of the Ectosperma and of the Spongilla and Spon-
gise. Since M. Donne has not succeeded in finding any cilia on the moving
granules of thc Charra hispida, and Ι have before shown that the sporules of
the Spongilla fluviatilis are entirely devoid of them, though whether they
exist on those of the Ectosperma clavata l ain not aware, but Ι apprehend
they (lo not: and most assuredly they do not, if those organs vibrate by the
sole aid of a muscular† apparatus, which, I conceive, will on further investi-
gations prove to be generally the case; and hence the iinpossibility of such
cilia ever belonging to vegetable bodies. With this view, then, of those sin-
gular organs of locomotion, I have also stated the likelihood of those cur-
rents, which have been noticed flowing from the lnoving sporules of the {Sea
Sponges, when examined under the power of 400 or 500 diameters of the best
microscope, turning out to be caused by some other agency than that of real
cilia. Such an agency, which I have before observed likely to be sufficiently
effective, is that constituted by the endosmosis and exosinosis of different
fluids, according to the beautiful discoveries of M. Dutrochet. Though I
should remark, that the thin membranes forming the coverings or envelopes
of the sporules and granules of plants are quite porous enough to allow the
endosinose and exosniose fluids to act: but where papillae or any cilia-like tu-
bules exist, these, most possibly being hollow, will I think assist the action of
those fluids, and so increase the currents by which locomotion is supposed to
take place. And this agency, Ι conclude, will probably be found general in
