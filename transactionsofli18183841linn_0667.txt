abundance of minute granules. If detached by means of water during the
globular state, the integument has a flattened appearance (TAss. XXXIX.
fig. 6.), probably owing to the inability of the membrane to preserve its proper
form. At TAB. XXXIX. fig. 7. is represented the spore with its membr-anons
integument when it has attained sutlicient consistency to preserve. the ova}
form: it has at each end an appendage of apparently inore delicate meni-
brane‚ the remains probably of what in an earlier state servcd to connect the
eontiguous cells. This connecting membrane—if such it be—is the only traee
of any connexion between one cell or integuinent and another; it is very soon
destroyed, and no mark of it remains in a more advanced state of the integu-
ment.

The next change which the integumeut undergoes is in the development οῖ’
the spiral satin-es, by which it is divided into two narrow hands with broad
and rounded ends: at first the ‹lividing lines are indistinetly seen traversing
the integument (Tau. XXXIX. fig. 8.); astera time they become more distinet,
and their spiral direction becomes evident. Two lines of separation run in a
spiral direction round the integument‚ and meet in a sinuous transverse suture
at each end (TAB. XXXIX. fig. ll.) ς these lines cut the integument into two
equal parts, the ends of which are dilated and unitor-1113 and these are the
clavate ends of the filaments which have been considered by Iledwig and
others as forming part of a sexual apparatus. The separation of the integu-
ment into parts takes place immediately after the edges of the sutures have.
arrived at their proper thickness3 it is therefore very ditlicult after this to find
the integninent entire.

At TAB. XXXIX. fig. 9. is represented the most perfect which 1 have been
able to find after the examination ot* a great number. The spore at this time
contains a greenisb-coloured fluid mixed with some minute granules3 soon
after it changes to a deeper green colour, its eontents become thicker, less
soluble in water, and filled with a greater number of grannles3 the fluid
which had previously filled the integument and the rest of the theca is gradu-
ally absorbed, leaving the granules which it contained sticking in masses to
the spores and to the separated partious of the integ-runem. It is these masse>
of granules, when found adhering to the filainents in the ripened state of the
spore, that have been mistaken for pollen-grains: when removed by means οἵ
