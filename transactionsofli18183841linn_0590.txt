ἃ 18.). This connexion is, perhaps in most instance-s dissolve-d at. an early
period, and the sporules recede a little from each other, but are still kept in
the triangular form by the mother-cell (ΤΛΒ. XXXV. fig. 121). lt is not un-
common, however, to find the connexion unhroken after the sporules have.
arrived at maturity; and in these instans-es there seems to be a general adhe-
sion at the opposing faces of the siun-ulus (ΤΛΒ. XXXV. fig. 17.). then
these adhesious are. broken hy violence, the adherent §urfaee of the sporule is
seen to bc transparent, and almgethcr deficient of the granular deposit which
covers the rest of the sponde, and the three radiating lines are most easily
seen in this state of the sporule (Tim. XXXV. fig. lS.). The mother-cell
rcmaius entire until the sporules have nearly arrived at maturity, but as to
what finally becomes of it Ι have. no evidence. then it is ruptured by ex—
ternal violence it assumes a shrivelled appearance, as if it had been on the
strctch and had eontraeted on the removal of the distention (Tan. XXXV.
fig. l5.). I have observed several instauces in which the mother-cell contained
hut oue sporule, whieh was in all the cases round, and did not exhihit any
signs ofa stall< or of radiating lines on its surfaee (Tim. XXXV. fig. lo).

Ι shall conclude this paper with some observatisms on the analogy that.
exists between sporules aud pollen, which is So remarkable, and the particu-
lars so numerous, that thc essential identity of the two ean, as I conceive, be
scarcely a matter of opinion. ln the. first. plat-e, the sporules are formed in
theca* whieh have a great resemblance to some anthei-s. They are in most
instanecs surrounded by a periehwtiiun, which is a collection of modified
leaves antilogous to the periauth. They are either sessile, or seated on a stall<
or seta, which may be named thc filament. ln ›S'plmgmtm the theca is elevated
on a pedicel or 1<=22fle>s prolongatiou of the 11xis‚ of which peculiarity the anthei·
of Euplmrhia is* υ parallel instance. The theeze are one-celled, yet they have
a columella, which may be lilx‘ened to the connectivu1n3 and although the
eonnectivum usually divides the anthei· into two cells, Callitrielte is au in-
stance in which there is but onc cell; and there are examplcs iu which the
eavity is spuriously divided into four cells, as in 'Fen-atheon which in ihi<
respect resembles the. theca of I’nlgstriclmm; and in the fact of evacuating its
eontents by a single pore, resemble-s the general structure of theeze. All thecae

arc lined by a distinet membrano, and so nearly does this resemble the endo-
