witlzv some Remarks on the iValwe (gf the Spongiae Mai-inse. 391

ing within the cells or canals of this kind of Sponge‚ is one, Ι believe, at pre-
sent unknown, and one of a very remarkable form and character. It is 111
appearance not unlike a wingless Aplzis; 11 varies somewhat in size, probably
according to its age; 15 apterous and of a green colour, much resembling that
of the Sponge itself‚ but is occasionally rather more marked with brown. It
seems to inhabit this Freshwater Sponge alone, for I do not recollect to have
noticed it. in any other 111-0111161100 ; 11 burrows in it, feeds upon it, eating away
large pieces of it; coming forth froin its 11016, 11 15 often seen walking over
the surface of the mass, and 16116015, particularly when distin-bed, within the
canals again. Possessing on the under part of its body certain membranaccous
appendages, which are clearly a sort of branchiae or gills, it makes nse of 1116111
for the purpose of breathing. Whilst it effects the function of respiration the
insect. remains within 115 11016 perfectly still, but only keeps rapidly vibrating
these gills or branchia] appendages, by means of which currents are produced
in the water near to the spot where it is lodged.

To this insect‚ then, I attribute for the most part those currents which Ι
have observed flowing into, and out from, the pores or canals of the Spongilla

have noticed similar currents or streazns in the water, the presence either of

grown and afterwards entirely invested. Moreover, Ι have never yet been

Sponge insects are aquatic and furnished with gilla which no imago that I am acquainted with posw
sesses. If regarded as larvae, it is difficult to conceive even to what order of 1056615 they belong, the
structure of the mouth being unlike every group having aquatic larvae: in some respects they are al-
lied to the larvae of the Hemerobii, which have long mandibles and maxillae, but these are all terres-
trial. We are too well acquainted also with the larva* of the Triclwptera 10 regard them as belonging
10 that order3 and in the Neuroptera we know the transformations of all the groups. There 15, how-
ever one anomalous genus, Aconti-opus. of which even the order is doubtful; and as we are ignorant
of its early stages, it may possibly belong 10 that.”

Having kept in a basin of fresh water for many days together specimens of the Sponyilla wherein
were some of these insects, and having never observed them even beginning to trans-form. I am very
much inclined to consider that they have attained their perfect state. A short notice of this insect is
given in the Mag. Nat. Hist„ vol. iii. N. S. p. 200, No. for April, 1839.
