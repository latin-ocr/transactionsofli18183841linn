Native of the Corcovado Mountain, near Rio de Janeiro.

This plant resembles [Μεζιμιςΐρςα very much in habit, but the singular form
of the stigma and the remarkable debiseenee of the capsule sufficiently distin-
guish it. It grows to the height of from three to six inehes, and is altogether
white with a yellowish hue: it has delicate fibres branching from a simple
root: the stem is generally simple, very slender‚ creet, often flexuose, some-
times even tortuose. The bracteiform leaves are erect and free, rather acute,
and very small. The stem is terminated by a pair of few-flowered racemes,
each generally with from three to six flowers upon short pediceIS‚ with a
single small bracte on its summit, where the flower is suddenly bent back at a
right angle. The tubular perianthium above the portion investing the oval-
shaped orarium is very short, and gradually eontracted a little below the
mouth, where it again expands, and its border is divided into six unequal
segments‘, the three creet acute sepals being alternate with the three shorter
petals‚ which are of an oval form, and somewhat concam, more interior, and
fixed by a short claw in the rounded spaces intervening between the sepals.
The stamens resemble those of Dienses-toga in all respects. The ovarium is
oblong, rounded, slightly conical at its summit, where it is free from the
pei-ianthium‚ and from it rises an ercet, slender, short style ; the stigmata, each
with two long subulate ereet boi-ns, according to the description given in the
generie character, are of a whitish colour: they nearly fill the mouth of the
tube, and are contiguous to the statuens. The somewhat trigonous capsule,
crowned by tbe persistent wither-ed perianthium and style, bursts only on one
of its angles in the singular manner described, displaying a great number of
yellowish‚ opake, scobiform seeds, which are crowded upon the three longitu-
dinal, berny, parietal placentae. It was found in the Corcovado Mountain,
close to the spot where the Dictgyostega orobanchioides occurs.
