tissues except in size. When the embryo is about half developed, the cotyle-
donary division is deep, and the radicular end small; but as the development
proceeds, the cotyledons² which were always rather unequal, become united,
except at their immediate bases, corresponding to which sites two indistinct
clefts may be found. At the same time the radicular end has become much
enlarg·ed²>=². Throughout its development the attachment of the embryo to
the process is slight, and very easily ruptured.

Finally, in the perfect fruit we find the viscous tissue oceupying the whole
space between the outer calycine layer and ovarium 3 this is fibrous, somewhat
indurated, obtusely 4- or 5-gonal, and prolonged upwards into as many points
as there are angles. The albumen is colom-less, fleshy, and of the same shape
as the eavity of the ovarium ; the embryo is clavate, lodged in the apex of the
albumen, beyond which and between its cornua the naked apex of the root
may be seen to project†.

The development in both the above genera is pretty nearly the same5 if we
except the want of the mammilliform process in Larsmtlum, aud the unim-
portant circumstance of the attachment of the embryo of Viscum being short.
The following conclusions may therefore be applied to both.

l. That the calycine parietes are from an early period inanum-ly connected
with the ovarium, aud that the whole tissue between the outer calycine layer
and ovarium becomes subsequently converted into viscum.

2. That there is a tendency, varying in degree, in Lorantlms in the ovarium
itself to become softened down into viscum.

3. That in Lot-anthus the ovarium is at an carly period solid, as it is likewise
in Viscum, if we look merely to the formation of the embryo.

Kl. That the ovulum is formed subsequently to fecundati0n3 that its deve-
lopment takes place. in a cavity formed by the excavation of part of the tissue
of the ovarium„

5. That the excavation commences as soon as the sphacelated line has reached
the spot where the Subsequent important. changes are to be carried on.

6, That the first development of the embryo takes place a considerable
time after that of the ovulum3 that it is attached to the apex of this by a
cellular funiculus; that it is hence itself evascular.
