Dr. Schleiden in support of his theory, it would be premature to enter into a
full discussion of the subject upon this occasi0n3 but whatever may prove to
be the case in Alsietinew, we must, 1 11111111, admit that the remarkable organ
in the present genus is really a periearpiuin. In Pinus (Pir-ea) lum-teuta, for
example, these supposed pericarpia do not differ from the ordinary leaves ; and
in 501110 other 51100105 1110 transition froin them to leaves is impereeptiblc, the
exterior ones being in most 011505 11111·1·011. The supposed placentae present
a foliaoeous character 111 Abies 111111 1110-ἰν, 111111 111 1110 Silver Firs, where the
leaves are 1101101010, 1110 5011105 are constantly 51111111110, 111111 111 1111 011505 they
follow the arrangement of the foliaceous organs, which7 I think, would not 110
50 uniformly the case were they portions of the axis, and not 1111111111011110115
of the leaves. This 15 beautifully shown 111 1110 following· genus ⁴·Itl1rota.1·i‚s·,
where the female 5111110 1110501115 1111 1110 appearance of a young· branch.

ln szningltmnia and ,lmmcm'itt we have only one organ 111-050111, which 15
clearly derived from the leaf, and which pei-forms the. 1111100 of the supposed
placenta in Pinus, 111 1110 former genus bearing several ovula, and in Amnem-ia
one only, witb which it becomes 001111110111. The existence of a single floral
cnvelope in these two genera may bc aceounted for either by supposing that
1110 bracte and pericarpial leaf become confluent at an early period, or that
what I bave described 115 1110 111-11010 and pericarpiuin may constitute in all
cases but one organ, the scale being merely the enlarged 111150 of the peri-
0111111111 lcaf; a view which would gain some support from the change which
takes place in the leaves· of (1150115011 brancbes of the sprucc fir. Pavon, in 1115
1110111011· on Aram-urin imbricata. (1050111105 111111 figures the free extremities of

able in the young 511110, 115 11 bivalvcd stigma.

Perhaps the genus Callistris of all others affords the 111051 convincing proof
of the origin of the supposed placenta-2 for in the diss'ercnt 51100105 of that
genus we uniforinly find 1110111 regulated by the number of leaves in a verticill
which 0111151515 of three or four.

All these circumstances appear to contii-m the accuraey of the view taken
by Mr. Brownss that the scales are expanded pericarpia3 and it seems more

ff< In justice, however, to this learned 1101110151, I ought to state that 110 was the first to suggest 1110

very theory adopted by Dr. Schleiden as to the nature of the supposed p(·1·icarpia.—See Appendix to
