reaches the ventral extremities, where it bends down to midway between the
dorsal and venti-al margins, and so continues to the end of the tail.

The rudimental filamentary fins, the analogues of the four ordinary extremi-
ties in the Vertebrata, permanently represent in the present singular animal
the earliest embryonic condition of the pectora! aud pelvie members. They
are round, filit'orm, gradually attenuated to an undividcd point, resembling
tentacles or feelers rather than fins or legs, and doubtless wan-ieted to their
tactile funetions. Eaeb filiform member is supported by a single-johstml, sofr,
or eartilaginous ray. The pectoral tcntaelesit are somewhat shorter and more
slender than the ventral ones†; the former are two inehes, the latter two inc-hes,
four lines in length.

The. branchia] aperturos are narrow vertieal slus, four lines· in extent.

The eyes appear externally as two small round flat spots, of a lighter eolour
than the suri-‹mndiug integument: they are situated seven lines from the end
of the snout, and nearly the same distance apart from one amither. Each of
these. simple vis-nal orgaus measures one line and a half in diffluerem it is
not defended by any palpebral folds of the skim the cornea is thiu, suffi-
eieutly trausparent to allow the lens to be visible even in the specimen pre-
served in spirits. The nostrils are situated at the under part ‹st' the upper lip‚
within the opening of the mouth. They appear as two small perforations
leading to blind sues afterwards to be described 323. The opening of the mouth§
is wide, and defended by well-developed sseshy lips. The skin at the angles
of the mouth is thiuner than at the rest of its circumference, and the upper
lip folds over the lower one from the angle to near the fore part of the mouth:
here the lips are thick, smooth and roundedz the. lower lip is the thiekcst.

About a line behind the lower lip, between it and the teeth, tiu-re projeet
six soft papillose proeesses, of a triangular forum two of these. which are
situated in the middle line, consist of a transverse row of papillam the poste-
rior oneS are membraneus, and the papilla* are coufined to their margin and
outer surface: they oceupy the notehes of the broad and strong dental plate.

ζ In the Siren as well as in the Proteus, Cuvier expressly states, that the nasal cavino< communicate
with the mouth: and attributes to the ingenious naturaliet Olten his attention to this circumstance as
a distinguishing character between Fishes and chtiles—See Ossemens Fossilesy «ἳνα, 1837, torn. x.
