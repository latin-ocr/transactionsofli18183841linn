tirely concealed within the femora) it is allied to the Byrrlzisloe3 but the
leading character afforded by the maxillae evinces a near affinity with the
Entomoplzaga‚ amongst which the Gyrinidw must be considered the near-
est in proximity‚ Gyrinus bicolor, Fab. soniewhat approaching this insect in
forms

Very ample details were figured of this most extraordinary insect, which
certainly presents one of the most interesting instances of analogica! relations
which have hitherto been published. That such is the case, must be certainly
admitted, when the preceding observations upon its relations are considered
with reference to its actual affinity‚ since, notwithstanding its Gyrinoid habit,
clavate antennae, and subretractile legs, Ι have now ascertained that it un-
questionably belongs to the Citrahidce, and that. it is very closely allied to
Psemlomorplza, with which it agrees in the peculiar structure of the under-
side of the head, very short maxillary palpi, hatchet-shapcd labial palm, large
femora, slender tibiae, simple tarsi, &03²ss

I should probably have long remained in ignorance of this most unexpccted
affinity, had it not been for the examination of another carious heedc, also
from New Holland, which I purchased from a dealer, and which, having its
legs and antennae retraeted, Ι for a length of time regarded as a (iffi-imm:

Oblongus, convexus ; capite tenuissime punctato, transverso, genubus subtus maximis, et (eapite supra
viso) valde prominentibus : antennae breves compressae, in canali profundo ad basim receptae. Palm

natus; lateribusque antice paullo recurviS, margine antico punctis minutis valde approximatis, po-

lariter punctata. Pedes picei, femoribus maximis. Corpus subtus pallidius, rufescenti- aut luteo-
piceum, glabrum, nitidum.

I have never met with any Coleopterous insect which exhibited so great a development of the gena
on the underside of the head, here forming a large elevated plate on each side of the mouth between
the trophi and the base of the antennae.
