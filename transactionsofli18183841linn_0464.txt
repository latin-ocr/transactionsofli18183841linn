388 Mr. Hooa's Observatums onv tlte Spongilla fluviatilis,

be seen dye the paper with permanent 00101115 exaetly after the same manner
as the green ehromule of the Spongilla has done. But in order to let the re-
semblance be more conspicuous, l have also stained the paper (011 1110 1011
side) with the chromule from the leaf of Primula Sinensis, the ehromule 01 a
common C'ozgferra, and that of Olim-a vulgaris; and having placed these
beside the stain derived from the eolouring material of the River Sponge,
every one must be immediately struck with the similitude of their tints. In
fact, the chromule of the Confer-vu appears almost identical in colour with
that of the *Spongillm

The fourth: if a green piece of this Sponge and any common leaves be
steeped 111 strong aeid, the 0110015 1110 likewise 10 011 appearance very similar.
For instance, I took a living piece of the River Sponge 01 a bright green co-
lour, drained off the water, and poured some muriatic aeid over it; at first a
little effervescenee took place over the whole surface of the specimen 111 0011-
sequence 0f 501110 0010010005 matter having been deposited from the water
upon it; next, the 0011011 01 1110 aeid began to 11151101 1110 green and to turn it
to a rusty or iron 00100111, like as it does when applied to the green of fresh
leaves. The specimen then became very 5011 and pulpy, and losing its form,
put 011 after a further maceration the same appearance as that which arises
from a similar effect of muriatic aeid upon the parenchymatous substance
and ehromule of any green leaf.

And the fifth, relates to the disengaging of gas, in all probability exygen.
Whilst engaged in my experimeuts 011 1110 aetion of light upon the eolour of
the Spongilla, 1 repeatedly observed those living specimens when placed in

³³² As it is a well-known property in Chemistry, that the most common and powerful acids change
the blue colour 01 vegetables to red. If, therefore, such an aeid be applied to the eolouring matter of
the Blue Sponge (Sponqiu cau-ulem), and the eolour should thereby be converted to red, this would go
far in deeiding the vegetability of that marine speeies. As also, alkalies mixed with blue vegetable
juices turn them green, it may easily be proved whether that change takes place in the colour of the
same Blue Sponge under the influenee of an alkali. And l will merely mention, that it would be in-
teresting to try the effeets of aeids and alkalies upon the 00101115 01 the Red-wine Sponge (S. vinosa),
and of the beautiful Coral-red Sponge (S. coi-alliun), and thereby likewise determine whether the reds
be not 01 11 vegetable nature. In addition to these Sponges, other species of a purple and violet, and
01 a reddish, rose-coloured and pink, are to be found on the coasts of the Mediterranean in the vici-
nity of Nice, as we learn from M. A. Risso’s “ Hist. Nat. des principales Productions de l'Europe
Meridionalej' tom. v. Paris, 1826.
