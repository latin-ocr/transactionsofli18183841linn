THERE is no part of the structure of Equisetum inore curious or inore
anolnalous than the organs of reproduction3 and although the position of the
order in the natural system depends on the nature of these organs, yet this is·
so fai· matter of doubt, that very eminent botanists (lo not seem (leeided as to
whether Equisetacew are to rank among Phaenogainic οι· Cryptogainie plants.
In the following observations* (the result of an examinatior] continued

* These observations were made before I was aware that in part they had been anticipated. Tre-
viranus (a) appears first to have ohserved and correctly figured the spiral vessels in the cells of which
the thecae of Equisetum are eomposed3 and Meyen (b) confirms his observations, while he at the same
time criticises, and with justice, the account given by Bischoff (c). There are, however, several points
that appear not to have been examined, and my observations do not precisely accord with those of
Meyen. I venture, then, still to offer them to the notice of the Linnean Society‚ trusting that 1 shall
be excused isin any case I have been occupied on ground which has already been explored.

Since the present paper was read, Mr. Ι. ιΙ. Bennett has kindly pointed out to me that 1 have also
been in a great degree anticipated by Mohl in the discovery of the peculim* mode of the production of
the spore in Equisetam. 1 think it right, therefore, to give a translation of the passage in his mernoir.
which has been furnished by a friend.

“ The young capsules (of Equisetum varieqatum) are filled with a very delicate. polyhedral, cellular
tissue. These cells are connected together in greater or lesser masses, without, however, being sur-
rounded by mother-cells (if they are not rather themselves to be so regarded)„ and are filled with a
granular mass. In older capsules these cells are larger and distinct from each other, and the green
granular contents form for the most part a disc lying in the middle of the cell. In still more advanced
capsules this green disc is changed into an oval grain, xvrapped round with the two elaters, These
seem to arise from the splitting os the cell in which the grain is formed, and at first surround it under
the form of a closed integument. 'she grain itself possessos two 001115, of which the outer is mode-»v
rately tough, the inner very tender. I have never seen a style-like elongation like that with which
Hedwig has represented the grain.'’—Fl0ra, 1833, pp. 45, 46.
