:366 Mr. Hooo's Observations οη the Spongilla fluviatilis.

stantly seen specimens of this Spongilla of various sizes and gradations, and
to all appearance as if they had originated or been produced from these sin-
gular seedlike bodies. Moreovev, last March, having procured some of these
fresh bodies, 1 placed them in a glass vessel, nearly filled with spring water,
and changed the water every day; six of them soon affixed themselves to the
bottom of the glass ἦ and in about three weeks every one of them was covered
with a whitish and wooll-like substance, which Ι took for the rudiments or
commenceinent of the Sponge†. After that time I was obliged to leave
home, and consequently to give up all further investigations upon that in-
teresting subject.

I ought also to inform you, that Ifind from experiment these seedlike
bodies, when dried and long kept out of water, exhibit no such appearances,
and seem, when replaced in water, as if they had lost all their vitality and
power of reprodnction; neither have Ι perceived that they possess, even in a
fresh state, any cilia nor any locomotive propertyss whatever, wherein they
essentially differ from the similar gerins, or ovules, or sporules, of certain spe-
cies of the Sea Sponges, as described by Dr. Gvantt.

*⁶ This glass vessel, with these same specimcns, was exhibited to the Society on December 18th,
1838. Upon examining the small white patches with a lenS, they were found to be the true rudi-
ments of the Sponyilltt, having the cells or pores very distinct, and formed by the little anastomosing
fibres or spicula.

† A short time after this letter was read, my attention was called by my friend Professor Bell, to
Mr. Gray's paper (with which Ι was previously unacquainted) in the Zool. Journ. vol. i.. where at
p. 50 1 noticed that he mentions squeezing the granules from some specimens of freshwater Sponge,
and adds, “ There were a few partly dccayed leaves at the bottom of the basin, on which the green
grannles fell. Being called away, I lest them there for a day or two, when on my next examination
Ι found they had formed a more velvety mass through which visible fibros were shooting, which gra-
dually enlargcd, thus growing entirely after the manner of vegetables.’' This is a pleasing confirma-
tion of my own experiment.

ζ Nor has M. Dntrochct noticed the power of locomotion in the similar bodies which belong to the
Sponyilltz lacustris. His remark is as follows: ‘⁸ Enfin M. Grant a fait cette observation neuve et
curiense que les corps oviformes, ou les oeufs de l'Eponge, lorsqu'ils sont de‘taches et devenus libres,
sont animes de mouvemens spontanes comme des animaux. Je n'ai point fait cette observation sur les
corps oviformcs de la Spongille, que je regarde comme des sortes de tubercule5.’' Vide Annales des
Sci. Nat. tom. xv. p. 217.
