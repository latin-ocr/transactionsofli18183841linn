Fig.11. A quaternary union of sporules in their mother-cell, soinewhat ad-
vanoed ; each sporule contains glohules of fluid and a few granules.

Fig. 12. A 111016 advanced union of sporules.

Fig. 13. A different view of sporules in the same stage. The two minute
points on the opposed faces of the upper sporules Ι believe to he
analogous to the stalks which connect the sporules of Pilularia in
the young state.

Fig. 14. A sporule, which 11115 separated fron] the others by the bursting of the
mother-cell.

Ficr. 15. A sporule, which has been separated by a forcible rupture of the
mother-cell, a portion of which still surrounds the sporule, but in a
shrivelled state, appearing 115 if it had been overstretched.

Fig. 16. An instance in which only one sporule has been (leveloped in a
mother-cell. Ι could discover no signs of the stall< or radiating
111165.

Ρίσ. 17. Ripe sporules. This is an instance where the union has 1101 116611 dis-
solved, as it perhaps usually is at 1111 earlier period. The sui-face of
the sporules, at least as much as is exposed, is completely covered
with brownish granules. There are no signs of the mother-cell.

Fig. 18. One of the last sporules, forcihly separated to show the three radiating
lines and the minute stalk. No grannles could be deposited on the
surface at this point on account of the cohesion of the sporules„
