The size of the reproductive bodies is excessively minute, being not more
on the average than the τῆξ-0111 part of an iuch long, and the ffissffth part of
an inch in diameter3 some few however being much snialler, and others lar-
ger than these (liinensions.

Their number on one ergot, perhaps, is more astonishing than their mi-
nuteness3 for by immersing in water a full-sized specimen from the Elymus
when copiously covered, and making use of means for detaching them, a film
was obtained which thickly covered more than a square inch of sui-face ς con<-
sequently from a rough calculation there could not be many less than twenty
millions of sporidia on this specimen, supposing the filiu was only one layez· in
thickness.

W'hen these minute bodies arc lnoistened with water and magnified about
500 to 600 times linear, their structure becomes just discernible, and there
can be observed in their interior a rounded nucleus οι· granule, or sometimes
two or three such, which are of a greenish colom-Q very scldom it is that,
there are more than three; and occasionally sporidia will bc found that do
not contain any grannlcs: all of which varieties are mentioned and accurately
figured by Phoebus in his account of these bodies, and their dissiinilarity as
well as their containing small corpuscules caused him to doubt their being
fungic sporidia.

The size of these granules was generally about one eighth 01· 0116 tenth that
of the body containing them, and may be calculated to be about -fffl—„Uth
part of an inch in diameter.

Having kept some sporidia on a moistened glass, evident proofs were seen
in a short time of incipient germinati0n3 and Philippar mentions, that when
116 moistcned cloth and strewcd sporidia upon it, they presented the appear-
ance of having germinated ε to examine this fact inore perfectly, some of these
bodies were placed on a slip of glass, {noistcned with distilled water, and co-
vered with a thiu plate of mica, and it was found immediately that a move-
ment existed among them, such Ι considered as was discovered by Mr. Brown
to exist amongst all fine particles, whether organic or inorganic, when placed
so as to have free motion in water3 the sporidia under observation never
