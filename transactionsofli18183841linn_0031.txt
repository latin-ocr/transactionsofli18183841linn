Grasses, but we do not notice it unless it occur in a remarkable degree, as in
the glumes of Phalaris and Beck-tmnznia. This may 110 110001111111111011 111111 11

most of those Grasses where the. onter palea hardens on the seed.

Comme. Rounded at the back, as in the paleae of the Panicew. This

may furnish examples.

The first of these may exist in union with either of the others, and to any
of them a keel may 110 added: two or three ternis may therefore be used in
1110 5111110 description, but they should not be eompounded.

In some Grasses we find the glumes or paleae of even texture throughout;
in others we fmd nervae, as in 1110 11111010 01 1110 Panic-ew, where they are quite
unaecompanied by any elevation of the surfaee. Ι cannot 01111 111050 511110,

In all these cases the outer palea, 10 which these particularities of description
chiefly apply, has a central nerve or prominence, to which Ι do not give the
name of midrib, unless it be stronger or more prominent than the others.

The inner palea has usually two 11115, 111 which the membrane is folded in
upon the parts of fructification. While 111 flower it almost uniformly follows
the curve of the outer palea, at least in Grasses where the spicula has more
