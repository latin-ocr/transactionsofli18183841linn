TO Mr. Brown is due the meritos having first pointed out the chief cha-
racters of this genus, and among others its binary ovilla, which doubtless
suggested to Salisbury the name of Disporzcm‚ subsequently given to it by
that botanist in a list of Petaloid Monocotyledons, printed in the first volume
of the Transactions of the Horticultural Soeiety of London. The genus,
however, remained undescribed, and almost unnotieed, until the publication
of my little work on the plants of Nepal, in which I gave a detailed descrip-
tion of it, and added to it two other species, namely‚ the Urularia Pitsata of
Buehanan Halnilton, and the [seulfo-ia parviflora of Wallich. SirJ. E. Smith.
in an article appended to that on Ucularia, and inserted in the 30th volume
of Rees's Cyclopaedhz, has referred the former plant to Michaux's‚ 01· rather
Richard's genus *S'treptopzcs³ with the name of peduncularis. To this view of
its affinities he was most probably led by the account of the fruit given by
Buehanan Hamilton in his manuscript notes, for the specimen of the plant
from that learned botanist in the Smithian Hei-barium is without fruit. The
characters of the genus consist in its campanulate perianthium‚ with the sepuls
produced into a short pouch or spur at the base, in the cells of its ovarium
hearing two ovula, in its baccate pericarpium, and in its umbellate inflo-
rescence. These distinctions will be found to be common to all the Asiatic
species hitherto improperly referred by most botanists to Unularia. As Di-
sporum is as yet but imperfectly known, having been adopted in few systematie
works, and as the species, now amounting to ten, are mostly nudes-oribe& it
occurred to me that a complete account of the genus might not prove unac-
ceptable to the Linnean Society.

This genus terminates the series of the Allelantlzaceoe‚ forming the transition
