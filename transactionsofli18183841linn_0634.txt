stlta MIERS on some new Bratilimz Planls

glabrous. subhyaline or opake: root consisting of a subligneous, some-
what fleshy, irregularly fusiform tuber, covered with numerous imbricate,
obovate‚ acute, whitish, reticulated scales, fringed with long cilia: the
root also throws out numerous threadlike branching tibres of considerable
length. Stem erect, slender, cylindrical7 subtlexuose, spirally twisting,
white, of rather softish texture, about ten 11101105 in height, sometimes
simple, less frequently branehed. Branclzlets 01001, furnished at distant
intervals with minute braeteiform leaves, and all terminated by a double
spike of flowers. Leaves alternate, obovate, with acute tips, 0111110, 1011-
0011110, without any longitudinal nerve, erect and adpressed against the
510111, about a line long, white, bearing a resemblance to small braetes,
persistent, and distant about half, 01· rarely an ineh, from each 011101.
Rus-emes double, with alternate simple pedieellate flowe1·s; 1101110015 first
asc-ending, then recurved, 50 that each flower is pendent, four times the
length of the bractes, three times the length of the flower at matut-ny,
each furnished with a bracte similar in 51κο 111111 form to the stem-leaves,
always either latei-al 01· opposite, and usually a little below the origin of
each pedicel. Periantltinm adnate to the 0111110111 at base, above tubular,
contracted below the mouth; 11011101· six-cleft, three seg-ments 01· 50111115
being more exterior, and overlapping the alternating 1111101· seg-ments or
petals in aestivation, white, persistent and withering, but deciduous on
the bursting of the 0111151110. Sepals oblong, 1101110, ercet. Petals obovate,
somewhat smallcr, 51101101· and rounder than the scpals, 01001, concave,
whitish, and often (1001110005. ,8710110113 three, arising from below the
0011110 of each petal ; filumem‘, or what may rather be considered as eon-
nective, an uncinate, projecting, fleshy process, forming a sort of very
small 11011011 attached to the perianth, and on its margin, on each side of
the point, are suspended two distinct parallel anther-cells‚ which 1110

displaying the pollen, which is ot' a dark yelloxv colour, eomposed of
closely-packed somewhat waxy granules, coarser than the ordinary grains
of pollen, and approximating in appearance to the pollinia of Orclzidece.
