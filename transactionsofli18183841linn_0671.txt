which they occupyz those occupying the lnuriform and other meshes near
the inner edge of the theca differ from those on the sides and outer edge; the
latter are well-defined flattened spii-al vessels (ΤΑΒ. XXXIX. fig. 14. b.) ; the
former partake more of the character of annular vessels (fig. 14. 0.).

In a portion of the base of the theca near its insertion into the peltate scale,
the organization is different froin any of the above ; it consists partly of fibrous
cellular tissue, something like the inner coating of antherae, and the outer sur-
fa‹·e is formed into sinuous ridges with hollow spaees between.

 

EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES.
ΤΑΒ. XXXIX. B.

Fig. l. Magnificd portion of the theca of Equis-etam hyemale, showing the
rows of inuriforn] nieshes on the inner edge, and irregular rows of
nieshes on part of the side.

Fig. 2. Portion of the theca, showing the outer edge and part of the side, on
which the ineshes are divided into areolae variously inclined.

Fig. 3. Cells, detached by means of water, when the spot-es have arrived at the
globular form.

Fig. 4. Cells, detached by means of dilute nitrio acid. when the spores are in
the oval state.

Fig. 5. Granules contained in the fluid of the theca3 a. in the early state:
h. lesser granusts, remaining in the mature state.

Fig. 6. Spore and integument‚ detached by means of water, immediately after
the separation of the cells.

Figg. 7 & 8. progressive states of the integument, up to that in which the spira!
sutures are formed.

Fig. 9. Forin of the integument at the time of its separation.

Fig. 10. Integinnent, partially separated.

Fig. ll. End view of the integunient, as at fig. 9, showing the transverse
sutuoes, which bound the clavate ends of the filainents.
