‘134 Mr. Wssswwooo on the Family Fulgoridae.

opinion, however, originating in an account given by Madame Merian of the
Fulgoga Later-naria, appears at the present time to be regarded as fabulous, no
other traveller ofany authority or credit having since observed the least traces
of luminosity, although the insect is by no means rare in South America. The
reader will find an annising fictitious discussion upon this subject in the third
volume of the Entomologieal Magazine, wherein the contrary opinion appears
to prevail; M. Lacordaire, M. Richard, Dr. IIancock, Dr. Burmeister and
M. Guerin, however are in favour of the non-luininosity of these insects,
which was also personally confirmed to me by the late lamented Prince Maxi-
milian of Neuwied*.

In the original separation of this group of insects from the great division
eoinposing the Linnaean genus Cicada, Linnoeus appears to have had in view
chiefly the form of the head, his characters being “Caput fronte producta,
inani. Antennae infra oculos: articulis ⁴23 exteriore globoso majore. Rostrum
inflexum. Pedes gressorii.” (Spsst. Nat. 2, 703.) Nine specics were described
by Linnaeus, all of which are subsequently noticed in this lnemoir. Fabricius
in like manner evidently regarded the structure of the head as of primary
importance, since, although his characters are simply “ os rostro elongato;
vagina 4-artieulata, antennze breves, capitatae? we find in his detailed de—
scription the character ‘⁴ Capitis fronte porrecta, elongata, adscendente, cylin-
drica, retusa.'' And amongst the species introduced by him into the genus, we
accordingly find species which agree with the true Fulgorw in no other cha-
racter than that of the form of the head, belonging in fact to a distinct family
as subsequently notieed. By Fabricius also and by Latreille other genera
were established; being chiefly separated from the Linnzean Cicadce, but
having in the majority of their structural characters a nearcr relation with
Fulgora. The chief of these were Flam, Lgsslra, Derbe, Delplzaar, and Issus by
Fabricius, and Poeciloptera, Citius, and ,Is-[raca by Latreille. All these
genera were united together into a separate family by Lati-eille under the
name of Fulgurellw, changed by Dr. Leach to Fulgoridoe, and from time to
time others have been added by more recent authors, as Germar, (inei-in,
Laporte, Burmeister, Kirby, &o

* M. W'esmael has recently communicated to the Academy of Brussels, a reassertion of the lumi-

nous powers in F. Laternaria, on the authority of a friend who had witnessed an insect alive in South
America (Ann. Soc. Ent. de France, 1837, p. lxvii.).
