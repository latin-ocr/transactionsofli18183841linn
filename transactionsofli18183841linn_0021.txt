JJr. W ooos on the Genera ‹ngnropetm Grasses. 7

frequently some small scales, which Linnaeus called nectaries, but which are
considered by some botanists as forming the true corolla of grasses, and by
ΜΓ. Brown as vestiges of the interior series of a hexapctalous corolla. They
are the lmlieulw of P. de Beauvois, and the glumellw of Richard. Squamula
is adopted by Kunth‚ and seems unobjectionable, as simply deseribing the
object, without determining its use or involving any theory of its origin.

Mr. Brown* has proposed a division of the grasses into three unequal
groups, founded on the tendency of the genera to perfect the lower, the uppem
or only the centra! floret. In the. first group the number of florets is uncertain.
When there is only one, the. outer valve of the corolla is at the inside of the
outer valve of the calyx. then there are two or more, they are either all
perfect, 01· the imperfection is in the upper tlorets. In the second group the
florets are either one οι· two ; the more perfect floret being always next to the
inner valve of the calyx. The third group has a perfect intermediate floret,
and one on each side either barren or still further reduced to a single valve.
The first contains the majority of the European grasses. The second, Sorglznm,
Andropogmz, Saccharmn and Panicum. The third, Illeroclzloa, ,lntlzotrantlnma
and perhaps Phalaris.

VVhere the object in view is an arrangement to facilitate the progress of the
student, we ought carefully to describe appearanees. But iu taking inore scicn-
tific views on the subject, we may be allowed to determine the nature of a part
by analogy, and pronounce that to be an abortive floret, which to unpraetised
eyes appears to be only an additional glunic. And perhaps in grasses the
most simple way is to consider every additional part without the palea as the
indication of an abortive floret. The tendeney of certain plants towards a
particular structure, even when the structure is not developed, is very im-
portant, and was perhaps first distinetly implied in the observations of
Mr. Brown; but we must be eareful in following this distinguished naturalist
not to push our theories too far, nor decide upon this temleney without the
support either of a very close analogy, or of some indications in the plant
itself. there there is no certain and definite character, different persons will
judge of relationship in very different manners. What seems clear and un-
questionable to one is very doubtful to another: and in arranging groups
