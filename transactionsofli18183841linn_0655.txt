ἐς WHAT is the monocotyledonous plant that furnishes these admirable
reeds ?'’ is the question asked by Baron Huinboldt, after giving a descript-ion
of the species of reed, of which the Indian Sarbacans or blowpipes are made.
‘⁶ Did we 566, 111 fact,'' he continues, “the internodes of a grass of the tribe of

with this remarkable reed; and the interval has elapsed without botanists
receiving any further information ou this interesting subject. No wonder,
therefore, that next to the plant which furnishes the active principle of the
famous Urari or qurali poison, the discovery of the reed by means of which
the Indian is enabled to send his poisoned arrow with so much precision into
