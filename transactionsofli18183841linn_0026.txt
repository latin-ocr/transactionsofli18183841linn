12 Jllr. lVooDs on the Genera qs European Grasses.

so iu all others, it is only a cantion to be attended to in all caseS, and a com-
plianee with the very just and important Linnean 1naxim‚—-tl1at the genus
must give the character, but a character does not constitute a genus.

The general infloresccnce of Grasses is very various. Zea is the only genus
which has any pretence to a place in the Flora of middle Europe, where that
of the barren* aud fertile flowers is different3 the former being a terminal
panicle, the latter an axillary spike. It is even, I believe, the only 0110 where
there arc fertile florets devoid of authcrs. In other genera the spiculae are
either scattered in a loose panicle, or in a eompact or spike-like onc; or they
are in a real spike or head, in which the florets are tiled equally all round;
or they are in opposite rows·, or they are in two rows 011 1110 same side of the
common rachis, which in that case is usually flattened to receive them, and
more or less triangular. The panicle is also sometimes disposed equally all
round, or the hrauches arc placed more on one side than the other, so as to
leave one part of the circumference destitute of 1101015. We must add, that
1110 spicnlae arc either solitary or disposed in pairs 01· gmups, aud that in
these groups the spicula? are all sessile, or sessile and stalked. The spicula¹
themselves are either all perfect, or some barren or 11011101, aud others per-
fect, and they contain only one floret and nothing more; or 0110 floret aud
the rudimcnt of a second3 and this rudiment is either below or above the
perfect floret; or they have two floretS, 01· 111010 than two florets.

From the combination of these particulars wc find among Grasscs the fol-
lowing modes of inflorescenee.

l. Spicula* solitary, l-flowered> or with not more than the stalli-like rudi-
ment of a 50001111, which, when it 0001115, is on the side of the inner or upper
glumc, aud therefore the indication of a superior floret, disposed in a panicle
(either loose or spike-like), equal all round. This is the arrangement in
Lem-sia and Oryza, 111 the PHLEINEAE of the following pages, in §Tunica-E,
AGROSTIDElR and the one-flowered AnUNfflNixcnlE.

2. Spioulae l-flowered‚ or with only an imperfect external rudimcut of a
second, placed in pairs or groups in a panicle equal all round. This is the
disposition of the llorets in the Lygeum, in the. ANDROPOGONEAE, (except, in

ᾗ 1 nse barren to express spiculae 01· 1101015 which have only anthers; fertile, where there are only
pistils; perfect, where there are both; neuter, where there are neither.
