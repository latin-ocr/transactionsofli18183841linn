by many botanists. It differs from both in its one-sided head of flowem, and
Ι readily follow Link in nmking of it a distinct genus under the name of
Oreochloa. Scleroeltloa (lm-11 has nothing in common with -S'evlerm either in
character or habit, nor ean Ι understand what induc-ed Linnaeus to join it
with Cynosurns. Its nearest affinity is that pointed out by l'alisot de Bean-
vois with Scleroclzlna procumbens, but this ean by no means be separated
from S. nutritium and the other Glycerae ot* blinith. SCLEROCHLOA thus formed
iz, Ι think, a natural genus, though it must he eont'essed that S. dara is very
different from the more. delicate speeies, and especially from the Hastam er-
Jmnsa of Kunth, which yet seems better placed in this than in any other
admitted genum but the dichotomous inflorescence, thiekened flower-stalks.
and connato glumes, might, isit had companions, make it the type of a sepa-
rate one. ; Trinius accordingly has named it §plzenopua

The purple stain notieed in Po« between the thieker part of the palea and
its seariose transparent margin occurs also in 1S'clerocl1loa, and in some speeies
of Fas-tufa and of Arena. 1 suspect it to have something to do with the strue-
ture of the parts, though I cannot point out the relation.

Ι place with Scleroclzlna two plants, not generally admitted into the genus.
I’oa rigida and Trita-um loliacenm. In the former, the outer palea is totally
without ribs and terminates in a small umero, but¹ its habit and one-sided
paniele agree very well with that of the genus. 'she latter absolutely differs
in nothing from the rest but in its nearly sessile fl01·ets; and the branehed
rachis and one-sided Spieulse keep it very ‹Vlistiuet from Triticum. Poa litto-
ralis, auet., is nearly allied in habit to Solet-orhloa: but the acute form and
deeided mucro of the outer palea obliges me to join it to Fas-tuen.

vacssnm was established by Brown on Festum fluimus alone. Smith
added several speeies from Poa. Kunth transferred these to Festum, preser-
ving from among them only G. (asnatica in addition to the original speeies
The two plants differ considerably in habit, and the latter has a paniele equal
all round, while in the former it is one-sided: yet the structure of the flowers
is so similar that Ι cannot separate them.

Eragrostis. Every botanist easily distinguishes this by its habit from Pon.
I think the, nature of the outer palea, whose texture is equal throughout, while

in Poa it is invariably firm at the base, and terminates in a scau-iesu extremity,
