Bowman for the speciinens examincd, which were gathered near Trelydan
Ilall, lNIontgomeryshire, on the Sth of August, 1839.

The other species to which Ι would direct attention is a ncwly-discovered
plant, first described by Fries in his Noritictrmn Fl. Suec. Mantissa prima
(p. 8.), under the name of (f, lealnplrestn. It was discovered “Ad litus marinum
Nol-vegiae australis, supra plantas salinas succulentas v. c. Chenopodiaceas.
Dedit mytts' For my specimen I am indebted to my friend Mr. R. B. Bow-
man of Newcastle-upon-Tyne‚ to whom it was given hy Dr. Blytt himself,
who gathered it “ ou the coast of the Fiijrd near Christiania? As Fries takes
no notice of the scales in this plant, it gave me great pleasure to discover their
existence in my specimen, in which the tube of the corolla is ventricose‚ and
the scales are closely adpressed to its surface; they are very similar to those
of C. epilimmz, hut arc more deeply bifid, aud have, as I believe, bifid not tritid
segments; this, however, is very difficult to determine, on account of their
perfect transparency and tenacity. Fig. 2. is intended to convey a general
idea of the internal appearance of the corolla of this speeies, whose segments
are broad and obtuse, and which has its stamens placed quite at the upper
cxtremity of the tube, far above the scales, and apparently upon filaments
which are alternately long and short.

I would add to the specific characters of C. europwa and C. epithymum,
which are given iu my former paper, the words—calyce corolla multo brevi-
01·i‚——an(l give the following as the characters of the plants at present under
consideration.
