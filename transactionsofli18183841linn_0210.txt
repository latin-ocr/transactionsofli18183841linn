that a brauch of the one {night reatlily he luistaken for that. of the other. The
leaves are evergreein subtilate, latei-ally eompressed, and in other respeets they
closely resemble those of that plant.. The structure of the reproductive organs is
even inore remarkable thau in any other of the Cupressitzea‘. The 1nale catkins7
which in the other genera of that group are terminal and solitary, are here
numerous, as in the normal tribe of Pinus, und crowded in a spike-like inan-
ner at the extreinity of the branchos. They are short, and the antheriferous
scales are crowded, sessile, aud closely iulbrieated, as in Armzearia ‹aa-celsa and
(Qoniiliglnonil. The theea‘, 5 in number, are uniloeular, very short, combined
together in a ⁴single series, coneealed at the base, of the scales, and open in-
wardly towards the axis hy a large rounded aper-ture. The female spikes are
solitary aud horne on the salue tree, and tuost frequently on the §aune braneh,
iu which ease they occur ou the interitu· hranchlets. They are globular‚
squar-rose. and about the >ize of a walnut. The most remarkable peeuliarity
ot' the genus, however, is that the composition of the inale iufloreseeuce seems
to he reproduecd in the female, the pericarpiutu apparently consisting of a
verticil of leaves combined together, alul concrete with the hracte, which is
here uiuch tlevelope‹l; the points of the pericarpial leaves, together with the
upper portion of the bracte, are free, alul crowu the niature fruit in the foriu
os subulate reeurved teeth. The ovula vary fron] -l to 5, and appear to bear
v<onie relation to the ‹livisions of the pericarpiunl hy which they are coneealetl.
The inore complex sti-11‹*tu1·0‹5›fthis genus appears to ulilitate against the view
{alx-eu hy Dr. Schleitleu os the female flower of ‚lhietinew in his interesting
iueiuoir on the vegetahle ovuluru, ot' which a translation is given in that valu-
ahle periodieal, the “l‘hilosophieal Mag-aziue aud Journal of Seiem·e‚'' for
February aud March last. According to him, the ovula in all cases originate
t'roui the axis, of which the placenta is a 1110dified portion; and he regards the
scale, or what 1 have described as an expantled pericarpinrn, in „lhietineag as,
in reality, the placenta, and what has hitherto been regarded as the hraete as
the true pericarpial leaf. This opinion he sountls upon au exaniination of a
nmmo-ons spike of Abies alba5 which upon the upper half hore female, and
upon the lower half inale, flowers, autl he refers to an uupublished work of his
