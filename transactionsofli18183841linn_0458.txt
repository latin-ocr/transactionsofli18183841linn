382 Mr. Hooo's Observations on tlte Spongilla fluviatilis,

ness I had the pleasure about eighteen months ago to witness the living polypes
in that Zoophyte, and to observe for the first time the actual presence of thc
cilia ranged along their tentacula, and the extremely rapid and vibratory mo-
tions of those organs in the water. That author has made known many
curious and important facts respecting the Binosculous Ciliotentacular Zoo-
phytes* in his interesting memoir, which is published in the Pliilosophical
Transactions for 1837, where, at p. 412, writing on the gemmules of that spe-
cies, he says, “ It would be impossible to explain the variety of motions which
the gemmules are capable of executing, were it not obvious how complete is
their control over the action of the cilia, which are their sole locomotive or-
gans. They generally swim with the convex part forwards, and with the
greatest rapidity. Sometimes they simply rotate upon their axis, or they
tumble over and over; or, selecting a fixed point, they whirl round it in rapid
circles, carrying every loose particle after them. Others creep along the bot-
tom of the watch-glass upon one end, and with a waddling gait ς but generally
after a few hours all motion censes, and they are found to have attached them-
selves to the surface of the glass.'’ He further adds, ‘⁶ The parenchyma of the
gemmules has a contractile power, somcwhat like that of Hydra, but less in
degree, by which the form of the body is occasionally altered,''

* These are the. Ciliobrachiate Polypi of Dr. A. Farre. 1 have long considered the tentacles
(tentacula) of Zoopliytes as presenting the principal and most characteristic organs by which those
animals ought to be classified in strict accordance with their natural conformation. The Ciliotentacula
would include a large and separate order, composed of the genera Flastra, Cellalaria, διε. The Pinni-
tentacula would comprise those Zoophytes whose tentacula are pinnated; for instance in the Goryoniae,
l'ennatulae, Sic.. where the tentacles are furnished with small pinnae. The Tabitentacula, the Actim'ae,
the llIadreporae, and the rest which possess tentacula in the form of siphons or hollow tubes perforated
at their extremities‚ The Planitentaeula, which is synonymous with a partos Dr. Farre’s Nudibra-
chiate Polypi, would comprehend those Zoophytes whose tentacles are quite'plain and devoid of any
lateral excrescenccs or appendages, as Tubuluria, Coryne, διε. ς and the order Noditentacula, the genus
Hydra, and family of the Sertulariadae, which have those organs covered with little knots, nodules,
or projectione. But the class Zooplzyta itsclf should be divided into two subclasses; viz. 1. Βίιιοεειιῖα,
or the Zoophytes that have distinctly two holes or orificeS, one of which is their mouth, and the other
their anus; to this belongs my first order. And 2. Unoscula, those with one orifice, serving both for
their mouth and anus; herein are supposed to be included all the four latter orders. Additional cx—
aminations, indeed, guided by some anatomical skill, are yet wanting for the purpose of completing
this tentacular arrangement, which would then be of considerable use in more clearly defining several
uf the most important characters that belong to those very remarkable animals.
