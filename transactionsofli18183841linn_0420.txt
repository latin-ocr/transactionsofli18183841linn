354 Prof. OwEN's Descriptitm qf'tlze Lepidosiren annectens.

M. Agassiz has confirmed this statement, and further observes, that the
ductus pneumaticus communicates with the pharynx by a large and regular
siit, which he regards ⁵* as bearing even a closer resemblance to the entrance
of the trachea of the l'ulmoniferous l'ertebrata in general, than the aperture
by means of which the lungs communicate with the pharynx in the Perenni-
branchiate Amplzihisffiss' In the Polyptems, lastly‚ we find an approachto
the &palm-iren in the air-bladder being double. consisting of two long cylin-
drical lobes, but of unequal length, the left being the longest, and extending
through the whole length of the abdomen: the communication of the trachea,
or ductus pneumaticus, with the oesophagus, is also here described by Geoffroy
St. IIilaire as consisting of a lissure provided with a constrictor musclc.

The I³r›(1spl‹1›·u.s·‚ morcover, presents a most interesting trait of affinity to the
Lestiflnsiren in the shortness and straightness of its intestinal canai, which is
proviiled with an internal spiral valve.

With these advances in the organization of the air-bladder in certain abdo-
minal Fislies towards thc reptilian structure of the lung, made by the Amin
and Lepidosteus on the one part, in the cellnlar complication of a single cylin-
drical air-bladder; and by the Pohspterus, on the other hand, in the division
of the air-bladder into two lobes, with the slit-shapcd glottis of the ductus
pneumaticus described by Geoffroy and Agassiz ς there wanted only the 00111-
bination of the three characters, as it occurs in the Lepidos-iren, of a double
as well as cellular air-bladder, with a rudimental larynx, to dissipate the last
doubts entertained by the stanchest realist as to the true homology, long ago
pointed out by IIarvey and Irlunter, of the vesica natatoria and ductus pneu-
maticus· of the ichthyologist.

Having indicated some of the affinities of the Lepidosiren, considered as a
Fish, to certain speeies of the Sauroid family, 1 may further observe, that in
the helmet-like plate into which a part of the frontal is developed‚ we perceive
a resemblance to the genus Heterobranclms amongst the Siluroid family of
abdominal soft-tinncd Fishes, most of the species of which also possess a
bilobed air-bladder counnunicating with the oesophagus, and are deficient in
luincreatic caeca.

then we consider also that the Esoce'doe have all a large air-bladder‚ and
