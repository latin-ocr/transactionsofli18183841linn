respecting it will now be untenable‚ and it will be requisite to correct also the
botanical relations of this body, in order to assign to its assumed cause a po-
sition amongst the lowest of the divisious of Fungi.

On comparing the characters of the minute parasite of the ergot with those
of British and foreign genera to which it is allied, it has been found so unlike
any of them, as at present constituted, as to deserve being made a new
genus, to which I have given the title of Engotcetia*; and after repeated exa-
minations of the Rye and other grasses, Ι have not hitherto found any material
difference in its organization οι· characters to warrant the making of those be-
longing to different grasses into different species 3 therefore Ι adopt the specific
term abor-1⁴{f'acz'ens1L for the fungus found on the rye, and believe those on other
ergotized grasses to be of the same species, when the ergots are of a similar
character.

This minute plant, from its structure and habit, will be classed among the
Fungi, and placed in the suborder Coniomycetes of Fries> and in the tribe ,Mu-
cedines, or in Berkeley's arrangement ofBritish Fzmgi in the tribe δ’μονὶιίωηιὶεῐ,
which comprehends those genera which have their “sporidia chained together
‘intoflocci at length ft·ee.''

The British genera of this tribe are th1·ee‚—Aregma‚ Torum, and Spilocoecu
the first of which has sporidia opaque and pedunculated, whilst in the present
plant they are transparent, and without peduncles3 the second differs by
having its sporidia filled with a grumous mass, whilst the plant under consider-
ation has one, tivi), or three well-defined granules in their interior: and thc
last does not show the sporidia arranged in moniliform filaments.

The characters by which the plant may be recognised are the following :—

Ergotoetia. Sporidia elliptical‚ moniliform, finally separatimg, transparent,
and containing seldom more than one, two, or three well-defined (greenish)

ranules.
g E. abortg'faciens. (Characters as above.) Vide TAB. XXX111.B. fig. 3-1 l.

'⁸‘ Derivation from Erqot, Fr. (Ergota Pharm. Lond. 1336), and ulrici. ονὶῃο.

† WVhen this paper was read before the Society, thc specific name used was obortam, which was
intended to apply directly to the fungus destroying the germinating power ot' the grain. and indirectly
to the more remarkable properties of the ergot. This term, however, is not grammatical, and by the
suggestion of .J. Pereira, Esqi, the present one has been substituted.
