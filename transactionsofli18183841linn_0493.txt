towards chia, Dromius, Tarus, &a ; and Deiean, without being aware at the
time of the observations of Mr. Kirby, placed it in the subfamily Truncati-

It is certainly a curious fact in the geog1·apl·1ical distribution of Insects‚ that
so aberrant a form as is indicated by the four insects noticed above should be
found 111 regions so distant as North America‚ Brazil, and New South i‘Vales.
This fact alone I should imagine must be considered sufficient to prove that a
wide geographical range is not the character of a typical group‚ as stated by
Mr. Swainson.

The two insects represented in the accompanying figures 5 and 6, are Rhy-
:opertltta (Steph.) pusilla (Faba), and Tomicus (Latr.)fuscu.s· (Marsa), which
in their xylophagous habits, cylindrical form, piteily-ferrugineus colour‚ punc-
tated sui-face, transversely rugose thorax extending over the concealed head,
dentatc tibice, and short antennae, are so very nearly alike, that by many au-
thors they have been even placed in the same genus. A minute investigation
of their structure proves them however to be totally different in their essential
organs, the antcnnae, trophi and tarsi. In these respeets Tomicas will 116 found
to belong to the group having the elm-dcstroying Srolgstus as its type; whilst
Rllyzopertlza is most nearly allied to the genus Bostricllus of Geoffroy (Der-
mestes capucium, Linn.). These two groups have indeed by many persons
been considered to belong to the same family Bosa-ichidoe3 and even by those
who have ventui-ed to place them in different groups‚ they have been made to
follow each other without any intervening link3 being indeed employed when
thus connected to form the transition between the Pentamerous Ptinidoe and
the Psetulotetramerous C'arculionidoe, to which last Scolytus most intimately
approaches.

That the relation between these two groups, notwithstanding the many
points of connexion, in habit, economy, and even structure, is not an affinsty,
but merely an analogy‚ Ι entertain very little doubt, but our comparative
ignoranee of the structure and larvae of the Xylophagous insects of Latreillc
