136 sslr. WESTWOOD οη the Family Fulgoridae.

nean and Fabrician Fulgrwce, including the well-known Chinese species Fal-
gom! Cumlelaria, the European Fulgura ezcropwa, ἃς. were placed in the
genus Flam. The character, however, upon which this separation was
founded cannot. he maintained, since in F. Camlelaria and its allies the sepa-
ration between the forehcad and the clypeus is strongly marked, and cven in
F. tenebrosa the linc of separation may he. clearly pcrccived.

M. (fiiuerin in his description of the insects collected in the “Voyage de
Bela11ge1·‚”gave another classification of the family, consisting of seventeen
genera3 aniongst which Flam and its allics are ¹separated from Fulgura and
its allics, by the size of the prothoraxq which is 1nuch narrower than the nlcso-
thorax, and deeply notchcd hehind3 whereas in the latter the prothorax is
‘⁵ presque aussi large quc le inesothorax’, et tres peu echanere en a1·1·ierc.''

This last seetion consists of the following genera, thus tabularized:

Second-joint ot'the. Forchead prolonged into a rostrum . . Fulget-a.
antennae globosc. Forehcad not prolonged. . . . . . Eumallia.

(Plzenatr, (ierinar.)
Forcheadlongitudinal . . . , . . Apltwna.

Second joint Of thss{ (siphum, Burm.)

antennae oval
Forchead transverse . . . . . . . Lyso-u.

By this arrangement, the character derived fron} the produced anterior
part¹ of the head is made sccondary to that of the form of the antcnnaet. and
consequently we tind that some of the speeies of Aplmmt, (Α, disc-olor, A.
sissent«, Guer„ A. nigro-111(stillata, Gray,) havc the hcad produced into a rc-
curved horn, as is also the case with Fulgura recum-a, which ought also to he
considcrcd, according to this arrangement, as an Astlmme. Burineistcr has.
however, given another arrangenwnt, of these allied genera, which in sonte

‹legrcc alters the liniits of the genus Fulgura, and which is as follows:

a. Front of thc head not rostrated.

ᾗ Second joint of the antenna¹ elongate-ovate.

Forehead broader than long . . . . . . . Poeocera.
Forehead longer than broad or quadrare . . . Aplzana.

g& Second joint of antennae globular.
Forehead without elevated central carinae . . . Lysim.
