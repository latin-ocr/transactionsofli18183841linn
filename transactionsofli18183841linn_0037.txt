racters. He says of the paleae of Paspalmn, “inferior superiorem binerviain
amplectens ;'' of those of Panicum, “inferior superiorem parinerviam amplec-
tens.'' If by perimet-riam we are to understand that the interior palca has the
same number of nerves as the exterior, it would be a curious distinction, and
in opposition to the general structure of the flowers of Crassos, which requires
a central rib in the outer palea and rejects it in the inuer. This, however.
does not agree with the fact, and we must theref‹;›1·e suppose him to mean that
the nerves of the interior palea are in pairs, and that. there is consequently an
even number of them, and this would not exclude the ‘⁵ paleam binerviam'' os
Paspalum. In those Panicums which Ι have examined I find two nerves and
no more in the interior palea. On the whole, I confess myself unable to make¹
out any (lifference between Paspalum and Digitaria, for the spiculae of the
former seem always to be disposed in rows on the same side of a flattened
rachis as in the latter3 and the spiculae, as far as I can make out, are some-
times, but not constantly, in pairs iu both genera.

In our species of Digitariu the loweruiost spiculae in luxuriant specimens
are three together; the uppcr ones are usually solitary3 the intermediate ones.
forming the greater number, arc in pairs, one of which is sessile, or very nearly
so, and the other stalked. This genus, as Ι have already said, is not admitted
by Kunth; and indeed the one-*sided digitate spikes, which form at once so
evident and so beautiful a character, would not, on the generally received prin>
eiples of botanical science, be acknowledged as a sufficient mark of separation.
Sir J. E. Smith seems rather to have endeavoured to deceive hiniselt'into a
belief of the difference between Panicum and Digitaria by placing Digitarin
among the oue-flowered, aud Panicum among the two-flowered Grasses, than
to have been really convinced of it. And while Digitaria has an additional
glume to the calyx, and the additional floret. of Panicum is reduced to a single
valve, so very much like an additional glume that Sir James does not attempt
to give any mark by which they may be practically distinguished, we cannot
admit a separation merely on this ground Sir W. Hooker adds, that the flowers⁴
are in unilateral spikes, and this is the distinction Ι am contending foi-3 and
I think we may be allowed to use the word spike with this latitude, though
some of the florets are evidently stalked.

OPLISMENUS has a small point to the outer palea, and the nerves of the inner
