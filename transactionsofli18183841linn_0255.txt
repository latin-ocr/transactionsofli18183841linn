PROMINENT among· the trees which adorn the forests of Gaiana, and
which astonish by their profuse verdure and giganti«) sizc, stands the inajestic
illm-(1, the king of the forest. Rising to the height of fron} sixty to ninety feet
before. it gives ont its branches‚ it towers over the wall-like vegetation which

whether in or out of the water.

With this property it unites another of cq·1al consideration to builders3 it is
