384 Mr. HoGG's Observations ons tlte Spongilla fluviatilis,

than either to the locomotive gemnmles of Zoophytes, or to the Volvoces*
themselves, we may justly conclude that the sporulcs of the Sponges are of a
vegetable nature.

Furthermore, I consider that those hairlike, vibratory‚ and minute append-
ages called cilia, as instruments of locomotion‚ acting somewhat after the
manner of little oars οι· fins, are peculial· to animals and to animal substances‚
and that they never can exist upon any vegetable† production whatever.
Grant, Dalyell, Farre, Johnston, and others, describe the gennnules of Zoo-
phytes as being fnrnishcd with these cilia, and that by them alone they are
impelled through the water. The body of the Volvooe globutm· is likewise
covered with similar organs according to Professor Ehrenberg, who has be-
sides discovered that thc cilia of the Infzworia have extremely small muscles
attached to their roots‚ by which the vibratory motions are performed. Those
naturalists, then, who reason solely from analogy‚ would, from the similar
movements of the sporules of the Ectosperma and Sponges, at once decide that
all those sporules move by the same means by which the Infusorians and the
gemmules of the Zoophytes do, and consequently, that they have such cilia.
But here analogy is of no assistance: for these organs of locomotion have
never yet been discovered on any vegetable body, although sought for with the
aid of very powerful magnifiers. M. Donne very rccently‚ in endeavour-ing to
ascertain the cause of the circulation in the Charo, pressed out from a tube of
the Chat-a hispida a great number of granules3 amongst these were seen some
which had a rotatory movement, more or less rapid‚ independent of the
movement of general circulation: some turned round on themselves without
changing place: others were carried along by the current, but still preserving
their spontaneous rotatory movement. He supposed that they possessed cilia
as organs of their motions, but records, “I examined if there existed vibra-

* Recent microscopic examinations of some of the Iususoria, (among others) of Menas lens, Kolpocla
mzcullas, Brachiomts ovalis, ἃς. have shown to mc, that in addition to the characteristic distinctions
pointed out in the text, these animalcula plainly differ from the locomotive sporules of the Sponqilla
by their great restlessness‚ and by their being almost constantly engaged in searching for, or hunting
after, their food or prey.—.J. H„ Feb. 12, 1839.

† Of course, I need scarcely observe, those fine hairs or fflnges, which are named cilia by botanists,
and occurring on different vegetable substances, are perfectly distinct.
