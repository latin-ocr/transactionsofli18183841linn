outer palea of the perfect floret being always within the outer glunies. The
glunies are large, nearly equal, completely inelosing the florets. I have ad-
mitted aniongst theni Zea and Lygeum without being able to give a good
reason for doing so. The latter especially scenis to ine to have little relation-
ship to the rest of the tribe3 but Ι follow Kunth, since I know not where to

l. Phalaris. Gluines naviculas, carinate, herbaceo-membranous, including.
Extcrnal florets, scale—like, neuter. Paleae coriae-eous, closely investing
the seed.

2. Antlmimmtlzum. Glunies nwmbranous, including. External florets neuter,
each os one large palea, both of thern awned. Perfeet floret diandrous.
Paleae scariose.

3. Hierochloa. Glumes ιιιυιιιΙη-ειηοιις, thin. Externa! florets triandrous. Per-
fect floret ‹handu-ons. I'aleae firnlcr than the gluines.

4. Zea. Barren florets 2 in a spicula, disposed in a terminal paniele. Fertile
floret l in each spicula, with external abortive rudiments (lisposed in a
dense lateral spike.

5. Lygeum. Glunies 0. Spiculae all fertile, in pairs or threes‚ uniting at last

to form a 2- or 3-secded nut.

PHALAms has in most speeies two sinall fleshy scales at the base of the per-
fect floret, often tipt with haim, and I think 1 ean sometimes (liseern traces
of a fihny interior palea. In P. canat-[ensis the additional floret is larger and
inore like the paleae of the perfect floret both in size and substance than it is
in any other Europcan species.

1 have no hesitation in considering the parts which used to be described as
the corolla of ANTHoXANTHUM as abortive florcts, because I think the presence
of a inidrib and central awn a very strong proof that the upper of these cannot
be an interior palea. This genus and IIIERoenLoA I ani quite ‹lisposed to
place with the J’lmlaridea›; but 1 find it inore difficult to say why ΑιιηΗΕΝΛ-
THERUM should not also be placed aniongst them. It has, however, only one
barren floret, without any rudhnent or indication of a second, and the fertile
floret is consequently placed within the superior glunic as in the Panicew.

Kuntli attributes to it the filiform rudiment of a superior floret, which is not
