This interesting and hitherto little-known species is a native of Gosaingthan
and Kainaon in the Iliinalaya iiionntains, where it was gathered hy Dr. Wal-
lieh's collectors, and was first described by me in the PJ-‹nlmmms Flora²
Nepalensis. The flowers are considerably laiger, and more abundant, and
the plant is altogether more showy than the amplerg'fblius, froin which its
straight naked pedunclts blunt sepals and anthei-s, much longer stigmata,

and inore numerous sceds will readily distinguish it.

This very natural genus, as I have already stated, forms the transition from
the Smilla-esc to the Allelantlzaceoe, and possesses several characters in eom-
mon with *S'treptopus and Πίερον-(ιω. From the former genus it is essentially
distinguished by its inach more lengthened filainents, binary pendulous ovula,
and termina! uinbellate infloreseenee‚—eharaeters in which it agrees with
Differ-unm but it differs from this last in its innate anthers‚ nearly concrete
styles‚ and pendulous seeds.

The genus is remarkable for its forked pubescence3 the hairs are furnished
with one, rarely with two short branchos, which are continuous with the cells
