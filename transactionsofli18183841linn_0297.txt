Mv DEAR Sia,

Ι CANNOT discover any notice of Stomata having been observed on Mosses
in anyauthor within my 1611611ἥῆ and Professor Lindley states in his Introduc-
tion to Botany‚ and in his Ladies' Botany‚ that they are not to be found in this
order ; and certainly the opinion of their absence is not much to be wondered
at, for in by far the greater number of speeies it is difficult to detect them.
Their situation is very remarkable, being confined, with one exception, to the
theca. I first detected them whilst examining a section of the theca of Bryant
crudum with a triplet. It struck me, from the arrangement of the subcuta-
neous tissue of the apophysis in one spot, that a stoma was above it, and upon
scraping off the subcutaneous tissue of a portion of the theca, I discovered
the stomata in great numbers on the apophysis. I then examined other spe-
eies, and found that wherever there was an apophysis they existed, aud as in
Brgflcm crmlum, only on the apophysis. There appeared to be a very good
reason why they should not be found 011 any other spot, for the apophysis
appeared to be the only part having sufficient thickness of tissue to allow of
the proper arrangement of the subcutaneous cells; and this appeared still
more striking after examining the apophyses of several species of Splaelznunz,
where they exist in considerable abuiulanee, with one eurious exception,
S. ampallaceum, on whose apophysis they are eonfined to the upper part,
which is the only spot where the subcutaneous tissue has not separated from
the cuticle. A more extended examination of species seemed to confirm this

opinion, but at length the discovery of their occurrence over the whole of the

'¹‘ 'she first discovery of stomata 111 Messes is due to Treviranus, who observed them several years ago
on the apophyses of Splaclzmzm spltcericzmz, mnioides, ampullacezmz, and in several species ofBryum. Unger
(Etanth. der Pflmm. 1833.) has since noticed them in Bryum turbinatam and Bam-amia fontana,
