acute teeth‚ with an intermediate slender geniculate and twisted dorsal
awn. Sced without a furrow and without a erest,

ὁ. Avena. Gluines nearly equal, 2 οι· more flowcred, herbaceous, with a sca-
riose margin. Outer palea δραι-1050, nei-ved, ending iu two points, with
an intermediate geniculate and twisted dorsal awn. Secd furrowed‚ and
hairy or ercstcd, elliptic-oblong, attached to the inner palea.

6. Gaudium. Spicula* many-flowered‚ in two opposite rows ou an alternately
cbannelled brittle rachis. Glumes very unequal, the longest (superior)
much shorter than thc spicula.

. Arrhenatlwrum. Glumes 2-flowered‚ the lower barren, with a geniculate
and twistcd dorsal awn. Awn of the fertile floret short and straight.
Palete scariose, the outer ribbed and ending in two points

8. Holcas. Gluines 2-flowered, the lower perfect, awnless ς the upperbarren or

perfect, with a dorsal awn. Palem without ribs, hai-dening on the seed.

9. Dantlzonia. Gluines 2—-3-flowered‚ ineiiibranous, as long as the spicula.

Outer palea quite smooth and coriaecous below, rounded at the back,

bifid, with a firm, broad, intermediate point, which sometimes becomes

the base of a geniculato awn.

The difference of habit scenis to justify the separation of I)escl1ampsia from
slim. It has usually the more or less perfect indication of a third floret, which
is wanting in the latter genus. The straight awn also rising from near thc base
is never wanting, and such an awn is found in no specics of Aira. I am more
inclined to rest upon this character than upon the 4 teeth of the paleae, which,
it seems to me, are not cut with such precision as to give much confidence in
their always oecurring in the. same number; and similar teeth are not unfre-
quent in iliraflerzwsa. Indeed Ι find hardly any Grass where this part has
the firmness and rcgularity exhibited in the figures of Palisot de Bcauvois. Ι
unite Cmymeplzmws and :lirostsis to the remaining species of Anni. The first
has a distinet aud beautiful character in its clubhed awn and the little tuft of
hairs at the genicula, but the habit is that of some species of Afra. Ait-opsis
has been separated on its want of an awn, and on the three lobes or teeth
which terminate the inner palea. Yet Kunth says, ‘⁶' obsolcte triloba‚'' which
does not iudicate a clear distinction. that he considers as genuine species
