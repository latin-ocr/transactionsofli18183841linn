JIJ‘. W'oons on the Genera qf Europam (ἲν-((3393. 49

with regard to these characters, as to almost every other, we have herc a tribe
in which they vary? Perhaps we may find in some of the tropieal genera of
Rotthoelliacew an approach to the Pinacem, reducing the arrangement of the
whole family to a circular order. Ι have only three genera to notice, con-

taining in all but six species.

l. Nardus. Spiculae in two rows‚ on one side of a continuone rachis. Glumes 0.
Outer palea keeled, tapering into a snbulate point.⁷ Stigma ἰ.

12. Psilurus. Spiculae on opposite sides of the cylindrical but deeply channelled
rachis. Glume l, small. Outer palea membranous, awned ; inner as long,
scariose. stamen 1.

23. Lepturus. Spiculae imbedded in the ehannels of the cylindrical or prisma—
tical fragile rachis. One-flowered, with an interior rudiment. Glumes
l or 2, opposite to the rachis, and as long as the scariose paleae.

Psmmus nardioides seems well separated from Nat-dus. Schrader put it
with Rotthoellicm Palisot de Bcauvois called it Jlfmerma. Ι take it for granted
that valm-ns, the name given to it by Trinius, and adopted by Meriens and
Koch, as well as by Knnth, is the most ancient. The spiculae are placed some-
what oblique-ly, and the glurne is not exaetly opposite to the rachis, the abortivi·
floret on one side appearing conspicuously from underneath it.

LEPTURUS contains the 4 Enropean species which were formerly given to
the genus Rottboellia. lt has only one spicula at each joint of the rachis, and
this contains one perfect, and a superim- imperfect floret 01· rudiment. The
truc Rotthoellia lias 2 spiculae at each joint, one of which is tabescent, and the
perfect spicula has one perfect and an inferior imperfect floret 01· rudiment.

Before concluding this essay I will offer an artificial arrangement of the
Gi·aSSQS‚ founded chiefly on their inflooescence, which seems to yield the most
distinct and definite characters and is therefore best adapted to facilitate the
researches of the student, and enable him to determine to what genus any
plant under examination may belong. With the same object in view we may

observe,

That the spikes are fingered in Cynodmz, 1)(ισῄιχῖωσΐοηὶιιηι, Digitaria, and in
some species of Andr-opogon.
