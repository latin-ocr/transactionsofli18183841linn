WIIEN I was at Cairo in November last, M1·.T1·aill (Superintemlant of the
Gai-dens of Ibrahin] Pasha) showed me sonte young plants of Roxbnrgh's JIi-
mosa Sirio-sa, raised froin seed which I had sent. from Bombay. Both M1·.Traill
and myself were convinced of the identity of this tree. called in the Marat'ha
language Siras», with the Illimusa Leblsels of Forskal’s Flora AEgyptinra-Arabica.
Forskal does notv assei-t that this· tree is a native of Egypt,—-“ Kahirae hortensis
illa” is the habitat assigned by this author. There is, therefore, nothing to
diseonrage the belief that this speeies was introduced into Egypt. from India,
where it is undoubtedly wind, in the drier mountain-jungles of the west.

I feel at the same time convinced that the lllimosa speciosa of Jacquffl, Mise.
vol. iii. 47„ is also identical with the above species. The figure in that work
precisely represents the Indiam, and the Egyptian cultivated tree. I propose
the following speeifie character, slightly altered froin De Candolle's prodr.
Syst. Nat„ to include the three species with their synonytus.

Aeneia Lebbelc: inermis, glabriuscula3 pinnis plerumque 4—6—jugis: foliolis
5—-lO-jugis ovalibus subdiinidiatis utrinque obtusis, petiolis eglandnlosis,
capitulis pedunculatis aggregatis, floribus pedieellatis, leguminibus lato<
linearibus planis membranaceis.
