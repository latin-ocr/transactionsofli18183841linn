very loose friable soil. The 1005 01 1110 fore feet are placed very nearly 011 the
same line, the two middle, however, being considerably longer than the later-al,
and the outer one the shortest of all: 011 1110 1111111 1001, 1110 three middle toes
are of equal length, and placed nearly 011 1110 same line as to their origin3 the
two 111101111 originate some way behind these, 0110 on either side, 111111 though
rather 51101101, are still sufficiently developed‚ and armed with claws in all
respects similar: the lengthened tarsus, as in the rats and 111100, 15 00101011 111

These are very much the characters of the Campagnols (Ar-vivola), and
Gerbilles (Meriones), to the latter of which genera Camillo-us is more particu-
larly related by the length and development of the posterior 111011111015. 'she
pelt likewise is similar, being composed of a fine 5011 fur, of a uniform qua-
lity, but longer in proportion than that of the common 11115, 111111 without any
intermixture of long silky hairs. Of the 101111 111111 proportions 01 1110 head and

that Mr. Caley brought it from Sydney, as well as by the comparison which
Major Mitchell makes of it to that quadruped in the interesting extract which
I shall presently give from his Journal. The ears are long, upright and ellip-
