386 Mr. Hoee's Observations οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

causing all those temporary‚ and apparently spontaneous‚ movements both in
the seeds 01· sporules 11, and in the granules of vegetables.

Wherefore it is manifest, that the very similar movements of the sporules
belonging to many water-plants, and of the gemmules of Zoophytes, are not
effeeted by the sanie 111eans; yet, nevertheless, the design and object of such
movements are without doubt the same, namely, a proper dispersion of the
different species throughout “the waters of the (leep,'' and thus evincing a no
less wonderful than a beneficent mark of an Allwise Powcr, in providing for
the continuation and safe increase of even the most minute objeets of created
being.

Agahi, let 1ne proceed to enumerate to you certain other facts which have
come under 1ny observation tending to prove the vegetable nature of the
Spong Illaflewialilis.

The first, that I must mention, is the resemblance of the membrane which
clothes the soft portion or jelly‚ and entirely lines the pores and canals of that
Sponge, with that of the leaves of plants; this membrane or eutiele is ex-
tremely thin, delicate, transparent, and colourless, and seemed under the mi-
eroseope which Ι used as if most finely reticulated. l examined with care the
membranes of the leaves of many common plants, ainongst which were the
(misy, eabbage, stock, priinrose, lettuce‚ geranium, spi11aeh‚ and thick-leaved
saxifrage, and to me their general similarity of appearance both in texture
and in transpareney with the membrane of the Spongilla was obvious. Though
whether the delicate membrane of the latter be eellular, as Amici states is the
case with that of leaves, or merely porcus, or not, I have been as yet unable
to discover by reason of my not having at hand a sufficiently high magnifying
power†.

M. Dutrochet has described in the valuable n1e1noi1· before quoted, the

ἢ( It is not unlikely that a number more of the seeds both of freshwater plants (Hydropltyta) and of
marine plants (Thalassiophyta) will hereafter be discovered to possess, for a short time, the like loco-
motive property.

† 1 suspect, however, that if this membrane of the Sponqilla were examined under a more power-
ful microseope, it will be found to possess a minuter resemblance with the externa] membrane of the
leaves or fronds of the Fuci.
