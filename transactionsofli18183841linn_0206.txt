164 Prqf. DON⁷s Descrisffions qf' two new Genera (gf the

hold an intermediatc station between them. Their indefinite thecae, varying
from 3 to 20, aml their naked buds, will ‹listinguish them from suffetium,
while their fewer ovula, dccitluous pericarpia, and strobiliform female spike
will separate them from Cupressinew. The species of „It-aucaria naturally
separate themselves into two groups, characterized by peculiarities of habit
and structure, as well as by their geographical distribution. The three Poly-
nesiau species having four cotyledons, and presenting a differenee in the posi-
tion of the leaves in the young and adult plants, have also fewer thecae, aud
the crests of the anthers are short and closely imbricated; while the two
Soutli American species present no (lifferenee iu the position of the leaves in
the immature and adult plants3 the crests of the anthers are elongated and
squarrose‚ aud the thecae double the number. The Chilian Ammcaria imbri-
cata extends along the Cordilleras of the Audes from the 35Ο to about the
‚300 of S. latitudo, while the Brazilian species occurs in the provinces of Rio
ile Janeiro and Minas Geraes between the 15Ο and 25Ο of S. latitude. The
Almam-ia arcels« appears to be exclusively conlined to Norfolk Island, and
the Cmmt'nglmmii to the east coast of New Ilolland, between the 140 and
:30⁶ of S. latitmle; the other species (A. (holt-ii, ΒΓ.) is limited to New Cale—
donia and some small islauds adjacent3 and it is not improbable that the
interior of New Guinea or Boi-neo may afford a fourth species of the same
group, which, if it does not possess characters sufficiently important to rank
as a distinct genus, it at least constitutes a very marked semion, for which
Salisbury's name of Eutassa may be retained. The Polynesian species are
remarkable for having the vessels of their fibrous tissuc furuished on the sides
parallel to the medullary rays with two or three rows of closely approximated
and alternating ‹lots having a hexagonal outline ; nor am Ι aware whether this
peculiarity extends to the South American species, and to the genera Cun-

ninglmmia and 11anmzara‚ a point which I hope soon to be able to ascertai11*.

²³· Having recently had an opportunity of exaniining the wood of „its-aucaria imbricata and brasiliana,
and also of Damnum-a orientalis. 1 am now enabled to set this question at rest. The vessels composing
their fibrous tissue present the same structure, having one or two rows of closely approximated ‹lots
with usually an augular outline, which, however, is not so regularly hexagonal as in Araucaria arcela(
and Cmminyhamii, from the circumstance of the dots being often in a single serieS, but when they liap-
pen to be arranged iu two rows thcy are always alternate. The vessels of C117171i21qhamicz simensis have

th:¹ dots in single rows, with a circular outline, but they are snialler and more numerous thau in Pinus.
