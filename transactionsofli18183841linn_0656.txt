they came, increased their interest3 and one of my first questions on arriving
at 11 settlement of Indians which I had not previously visited, wa8‚ whether they
knew from whence were obtained these 100115, 50 different in structure from
all known Bamlmseoe. I ascertained at last that the Macusis received them
from the Arecunas, but that they did not grew 111 1110 country of that tribe;
on the contrary, the Arecunas undertook journcys of several months duration
to procure them from another tribe, who lived still further westward.

During the latter part of my third expedition 111 the interior of Guiana, Ι
likewise visited these Arecunas‚ who inhabit the northern tributaries of the
Orinoco, 111111 from whom the Macusis receive their reeds by barter3 and
here 1 received certain information that the plant which produced the 10011
grew in the country of the Guinau and Maiongcong Indians near the head-
111111015 of the Orinoco.

We saw among the Arecunas a large number of these 100115, which they
were manufacturing into blowpipes. The reed being so vahmble, and so liable
to destruction if carried openly through the woods, the Indian puts it for pro-
tection into the 510111101· trunk of a palm (a species of ΚιιηίΙιίιιὲ), which he
simply hollows out for the purpose. Beiug aware that the tube thus manufac-
tured is 111 constant demand by the other tribes, 110 does not leave the regions
which he inhabits to offer his ware for sale, but patiently awaits the visits of
the Macusi, skilled 111 manufacturiug the Urari poison, who brings him that
(leadly preparation, and exchanges it against these reeds or the ready-finished
blowpipe. By this mutual exchange, they are each rendered masters of life
and death over the feathercd game3 for, armed with his hlowpipe, the wily
huutsman gradually steals nearer and nearer to his victim, and launches his
weapon of death, which seldom fails of its deadly 111111, before the unconseious
bird is even aware of the approaching danger.

'l'he great object of my last expedition led me to that far west. We camped
on the 26111 of Jauuary near the river Emakuni, at a settlemcnt inhabited by
Maiongeong Indians; and the first object which struck me on eutering the
miserable hut which served as 11 divelling to the 11111111115, was a large bundle
of these reeds, some of which were sixteen feet long3 a circumstance which
naturally induced the inquii-y, from whence they came. The houses being
built on elevated ground, we had 1111 extensive view before us : at the distance of
