As the ergot e11la1·geS‚ there does not appear to be a eorresponding increase
in the production of sporidia‚ but rather a (111111111111011ς for when 11 11115 111-

porting any longer the increase of the reproductive particles which oecupy

in a short time emerges beyond the paleae with apparently few of the sporidia
on its exterior; 111050 that existed in the young state being now either de.-
tached from external causes, or spread over a larger surface.

When a transverse Section is made before the ergot protrudes beyond the
paleae, its consistence 15 found to have become more solid, still, howeverj pre-
senting a sinuous or lobed margin3 and immediately within the external bor-
der, which is eomposed of sporidia agglutinated to the diseased grain, there
begins to appear a purplish line, which is gradually shaded off inwardly till it
merges into a brownish white eentre.

After the ergot has shown itself beyond the paleae the growth is 51111 ra—
pidly proeeeding‚ and it soon attains a size varying in different grasses from
a fifth of an inch to one ineh and a half. This part of the growth is 11000111-
plished in a very short period of time, as Philippar mentions that he obser-ved
some particular ears of rye having 110 ν1511110 ergots, when in eight or ten
days subsequently he found the same plants had then perfect ones upon them.
At this period its sui-face begins to be deprived of the white coating of spo-
ridia, a few only remaining in flaky patches, which give to it the ‘⁶ sub-pruinoso ”
appearance mentioned as one of the characters of the genus *S'permoedia² and
the purple eoat that formerly was concealed underneath it, is now its 011101·-
111051 covering, and begins to lose its lobed and furrowed surfaee from being
distended by the development of the central part: at this period, though the
ergot is in a great part exposeth it has not lost all traces of the stigmas or of
the scales, but they are now become shrivelled‚ and its apex 15 surmounted by
