from that family to the Smilacew, the chain of connexion between them being
rendered complete by the intervention of a new genus, of which Streptopus
lmmginosus is the type.

111 the normal group of slIelcmtlzaceoe, which is principally confined to
North America, the floral organs are persistent, and the partial decomposition
of the trimerous pericarpium is almost. universal. The sslelmztleaceoe appear
naturally to divide themselves into three groups, namely, the Melantheoe or
l'eratreoe‚ in which the carpels are but partially concrete, the pericarpium
capsular, with usually septicidal dehiscence, the flowers frequently uniaexual,
the perianthium less coloured, and coustantly, as well as the statuens, per—
sistent, and the rhizoma fibrous; secondly, the C'olclziceoe, in Which the peri-
anthium is more highly (leveloped, the sepals furnished with long claws often
vombined into a tube, the styles long, the carpels concrete, the pericarpium
capsular with septicidal dehiscence, the rhizoma bulbous, and the floral axis
naked and liypogae01133 and, flzirdlgs, the Anguillarieoe, having the floral
organs frequently deciduous, the styles short, as in the first group, the car-
pels completely concrete, the pericarpium capsular or baccate, with loculi-
cidal dehiscence‚ a bulbous or fibrous rhizoma, and a leafy axis. The genus
s'olclzicum establishes an evident relationship through Sternlaergia and Crocus
between Meltmtlzacew, Ammysllldese, and Irideoe. The present genus connects
the family with Smilacew, and Trffieldia as clearly with szcea’, whilst a
comparison of the structure of [malm-ia and Erythroninm fully makes out
their affinity with Liliacew or Tulipaceoe. In Uvam-ia, which is closely allied
to Πίερον-πω, the perianthium is also campanulate, with imbricate aestivation :
the stamens adhere to the sepals at the base, and fall off together3 the peri«-
carpium is capsular, with polyspermous cells and loculiCidal (lehiscence3 the
ovula, which are arranged in two rows, are cuneate, angular, and carunculate
at the apeX, with the raphe forming an elevated ridge along their inner side.
'l'he flowers are axillary and solitary, and the capsule is turbinately triangular,
and sometimes, as in Uvularia. grandg‘flora, three-lobed. The seeds are de-
scribed by Linnaeus, Jussieu, Smith, and others, as arillate, but incorrectly,
they being furnished merely with a fleshy appendage at their apex, resulting
from an enlargement of the testa at that point. The same thing occurs in
Etytlironium, a genus belonging to the Liliaceoe or Tulipacece, and which,
