the Carabideous genera thus analogically represented not less strong. The
genus Car-abas, for instance, comprises species (Cat-abas gemmatus, F.) which
in their habit and the peculiar sculpture of their elytra analogically resemble
Calosoma Scrutator, whilst Cat—alnes Fabricii, &c., in the flattencd form of the
body represent Licinus.

Ι11 like manner, Catascopus, belonging to one of the subfainilies of Cum—abidae,
represents, as Mr. Kirby, in the memoir above referred to, notiees‚ some of the
inseets composing another subfainily, Benzbidiidoe; whilst Masoreus (a geniis
nearly allied to Treclzus), in the posteriorly dilated thorneie lobe, represents
Lehia, διο.

These Carabideons insects must however be regarded as related together
by affinity (as forming part of the same family), when a relation of ana-
logy is endeavoured to be traced between them and the speeies of other fami-
lies, as, for instance, between carabus and the Helopideons genus Adclium,
notieed above.

In order to illustrate the relation of analogy exhibited by an inseet belong-
ing to one tribe but possessing the aspect of another, Mr. Kirby, in the memoir
above referred to, described a genus under the name of Psemlomorplza, of
which he says, “ that even a practical entoniologist, if he chanccd to examine
a specimen that had lost its antennae, might at first regard it as a Nitidula οι·
Ilm, F„ or as coming near that genus in the system3 but when he came to
stndy it in detail he would discover to his surprise all the essential diagnostics
of one of Latreille's Entomoplmgi. The characters which give it an air and
general appearance unlike those of its tribe are its sessile wide head received
into thc thorax, and its short antennae and legs.''

For the purpose of completing the illustrations of this cnrions genus given
by Mr. Kirby in the plate aecompanying his lnemoir, I have here added an
outline figure of the insect now in the collection of the Entoniologieal Society
of London, the original being incorrect in the relative proportions of the legs,
and no notice having been taken either in the description or figure of the
ereet rigid hairs with which the margins of the elytra are elothed. Mr.Ki1·by
indeed describes the eyes as being ‘⁴ in medio pilosi ;” but this is not correct,
as it is only that part of the skull which borders the underside of the eyes
which is furnished with rigid hairs, which extend beyond the middle of the
