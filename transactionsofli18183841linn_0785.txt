Mr. BENTHAM'S Accozmt qs two new Genera allied to Olacineae. 681

structure of the ovary ς Endlicher* associates it with ,S'gsrnplofflm5 from which it
differs in the aestivation of the corolla and the ovary incompletely divided, two
points in which it agrees remarkably with Olaoe and Ximenia. The objection
as to the adherence of the ovary entirely loses its force, when it is considered
that the greater part of that organ as well as the margin of the calyx are free,
and that an adherence almost as complete exists in some species of Olalr.
The gamopetalous corolla is also a character of little consequence in orders
where the aestivation is valvate, and it exists to a considerable degree in Olmv
itself. The stamens of Schoelfia are more closely adherent to the corolla than
in other Olacimoe, but the filaments are filiform and prominent from the base
of the corolla, and not confounded with its substance, as in those orders where
they are truly epipetalous†.

Canqjjera has been usually referred to Thymelece, from which it differs in the
nature of the fioral envelopes‚ in the position of the stamens‚ in the structure
of the ovary, and in that of the fruit; and in all these points it agrees with
opilia, from which it differs only in the coherence of the petals.

The close affinity of Apodytes to [cocina will be evident from a comparison
of my figure and description with those of Adr. de Jussieu. Pogopetalum dif-
fers, however, in the compound nature of the ovarium; but each cell with its
ovules is so exactly the single cell of Apodytes, and the flowers agree so well
with the general character of Olacineoe, that the approximation will not be
found, it is believed, to violate materially any important natural affinity. It
is true that the ripe fruit and seed are as yet unknown, which leaves some doubt
011 the matter, though it does not occur to me that it comes near to any other
order. Leretia is in almost all respects intermediate between Icacina and
Pogopetalam.

It will be observed‚ however, that the three groups, which Ι have designated
as tribes, present some material differences from each other, especially in the
structure of the ovary, and may perhapS, when better known, be considered as
so many distinct orders. But with our present imperfect knowledge of seve-
ral genera, and considet-ing their evident connexion in many material points, I

† Mr. Brown informs me that he considers Schoepfia as a true Santalaceous and not an Olacineous
genu53 at all events, it is an additional proof of the close affinity of the two orders.
