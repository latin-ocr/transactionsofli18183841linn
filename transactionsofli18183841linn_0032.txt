within. The exceptions from such an arrangement are all that it is necessary
to notice.

An additional glume is found in some Grasses (the Panicece, for instanee‚)
an additional palea in others (as in «S'orgltmn and Phalaris), or at least addi-
tional parts putting on these appear-ances. These are always to be considered
as abortire florets. They arise in some cases so precisely at the same point
with the perfect floret, that it might be diffieult to decide whether they ought
to he considered as inferior or superior, if we had not a guide in their position,
whether within the inferior or superior glunic. In the first case, it must be
the rudimcnt of an inferior, in the latter, of a superior floret. In fact, how-
ever, all the cases which might at first appear doubtful are distinguishahle by
the nature of the adjunct, the lower floret assuming the form of a sessile valve
or scale, while the upper is always stalked‚ and frequently reduced to a merc
stalle which is not even eonstantly thiekened at the top.

within the paleae are the squamuloe, the nectat-ies of Linnaeus. These are
¹ often somewhat fleshy scales, hut in many genera they are thin and seariose
or fihny, putting on the appearance of minute paleae3 they are usually two,
and are met with lobed or entire in the same genus, and Ι believe even in the
sanie species. In Imperant, Lygeum, Antlmrt‘mtllunt, erspsiwg Alopeczcrus5
C'oleantlms, and Nae-(lus they are wanting, as they are also in most speeies of
Spar-tina and in Sesleria tenella.

The stamina of Grasses are usually 3. Psiluras and some speeies of Fes-
tum have only l ; Imperata, -›Intlma·antl1um‚ the terminal floret of Hieros—ldae„
(ζἰζιῃικῐκ aculeata, and one speeies of Bromius have 23 (hysza has 6. These are
all the exceptions that the limits of my work require me to notice. The an-
thers are oblong‚ notehed at each end, except in Lygeam‚ and perhaps one or
two more genera.

The germen seems to afford no character which is not better developed in
the seed.

The stignias are usually ⁴2, sometimes sessile, or nearly SO, sometimes on
lengthened styles. These styles are united into one in Sedes-im and this
seems to me to he the case also in Imperata ; neverffleless, where there are two
stigmas‚ most hotanists seem agreed to place the plant in the order Digzsnia.
Narclus and Lygeum have each only one stigma. Mr. Brown, from his obser—
