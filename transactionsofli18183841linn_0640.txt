Ι. A. sermea, Nutt.

()11 11115 species Ι 110011 only remark⁷ in justice to Mr. Nuttall, that he states
all his materials to have been derived from dried spechnens, and that he
could not distinguish the nature of the stamens. Had he been able to observe
the plant in its living state, he would no doubt have witnessed the curious
development of those organs so peculial· to the genus. From all that he had
noted and recorded of Apteria, there was sufficient ground for concluding
that my Brazilian plant constituted a distinct genus, and accordingly I had
named it *S'temoptera from the peculiar character of the stamens, although Ι
confess that 115 close approximation to Mr. Nuttall's plant had foreibly struck
ine. While Ι was preparing these details, Mr. Brown examined a specimen
of Aliter-ia semem in 1115 possession from the original locality‚ and identified
my plant with Mr. Nuttall's genuS, of which Mr. Bentham also examined
another species collected by IIartweg in Mexieo3 these observations were
kindly cominunicated to me, and 1 was favoured with the sight of a spe-
cimen, when 1 could perceive by transmitted light the holloW sacs in the
perianthium above described, and somewhat similar winglike expansions of
the filauients. Ι did not hesitate, therefore, to supprcss my generie name and

substitute for it that of Apteria.

A native of the Serra dos Orga-os, near Rio de Janeiro.

I have already observed, that in general habit and appearance this plant
bears much resemblance to the figure Mr. Nuttall has given of his „Ipteria
setacea: the singular expansion of the filaments and the swellings in the
mouth of the perianthium give to Apteria a very distinct character from all
the related genera. Its flowers are greatly larger than those of Dictyostega or
