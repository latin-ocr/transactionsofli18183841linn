were extraneous and parasitical bodies, entirely independent and unconnected
with the material of the Sponge itsclf‚ because they did so extremely resemble
some of the Infusorian Animalcules.

These bodies are very minute, though some are less than others, and are
plainly visible to the naked eye; they are white, of a somewhat globular, or
rather, more oval shape, the lower or smaller portion being opake, and the
upper transparent and membranous. Their movements in swimming were 110
less astonishing than elegant; ascending from the Sponge at the bottom of the
water to the surface; floating gently on the surface; or traversing the middle
of the fluid, like a balloon in the air; or suspending themselves nearly in one
spot; or whirling round and round, (lescribing larger 01· smaller eii-cles in the
water; approaching or avoiding each other3 but, when performing their
quicker progressions, they move along on their sides with their rounder ends
precedent. Indeed Baker's account of the motions of the I''0le·0.1⁷gl0bator*,
which he calls the Globe animal, is so strikingly descriptive of the movements
of these germlike bodies, and so similar, that I trust you will pardon me with
quoting it here: “It moves in all directions, forwards or boekwards, up or
down, either rolling over and over like a bowl‚ spinning horizontally like a
top, or gliding along smoothly without turning itself at all. Sometimes its
motions are slow‚ at other times very swift; and when it pleases‚ it can turn
round (as it were upon an axis) very nimbly without removing out of its
place†.'' Roesel has depicted that minute Infusorian in his work on ⁶ Insecten‚'
vol. iii. plate 101, at figures l to 3 inclusive. Yet the gerinlike bodies more
nearly in form resemble the description of l'olzfoae globulus‡; so much 50, that

* But the spontaneous movements of the Volvoae qlobcztor are performed by the agency of cilia:
for, according to Dr. Ehrenberg, its body 15 furnished with those minute organs. So indeed Baker
suspeeted; and he thought that it appeared as if it were set round with short moveable hairs.

’ᾗ This species I have never met with. But I have just seen many living specimens of V. ylobator
under the microscope. Ι could easily perceive 501116 different-es between them and the locomotive germ-
like bodies of the River Sponge, as well with respect to their colour and structure as their motions.
These Infusoria are yellower, much more transparent, and more completely globose; within many of
the larger are distinctly seen several young or round transparent bans, which altogether resemble their
gravid parents; they swam and moved about with greater power and w'gour2 and their more active
and busy movements struck me as if they were under a more decidedly spontaneous control or infin„
