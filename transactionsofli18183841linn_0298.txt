theca of Encalgspta ciliata proved its fallacy. Besides, in Encalypta vulgaris
Ι have since observed several similar exceptions3 in the genus Ortlzotriclmm
and in OEdipodizmz Grg'ffitlzianum they exist on the upper part of the fleshy
seta as well 115 011 1116 apophysis. In many mosses without apophyses, they
are found in a single row at the very base of the theca; for instance, in Tri-
clzostomam patens and all the Phascums, with the exception of Phasi-um alter-
›zlfhlizma which is destitute of them. Of one hundred and three British spe-
eies which 1 have exainined, seventy-eight are furnished with stomata. As
yet I have discovered 110 particular condition which is necessary to their
existenee; they are found equally on the most fully developed species, as
Hispnum rutabulum, as on the very lowest, of which Phascum serratum is the
best example; and, on the contrary, they are wanting in species of both ex-
tremes, as for instance, Hespnum. denticulatmn and lescum (tltet·11{f'(›li11nz. In
appearance they are generally similar to those of the most common form
amongst Phacnogainous plants, as represented at TAB. XXI. fig. 1ος occasion-
ally they are so like the surrounding tissne, that the eye would not detect 1116111
11 they were not the specific object of the examination3 and in several speeies
of ()›·tlwtricl1um they 1116 particularly prominent. Their number varies in the
different speeies very considerably, being very numerous on some, as Fumo-ia
lzgsgrometrica, and as few as four on others, as ll'eissia controversa. The con-
struction of the stomata is for the most part very simple, as in fig. 10, which
represents four stomata from the apophysis of Dissodon splaclmmisles. Each
stoma is formed of two oblong 16111101111 66115, with their concave sides op-
posed to each other, by which means 1111 aperture is formed in the cuticle.
Fig. ll. represents a section of one of these stomata. This form appears to
be hy far the most general, as Ι have ohserved only two exceptions. Fig. l,
2, 3, 4, and ι’) represent one of these exceptions, which is confined to five of the
British species of (hwlmtrichum ; and fig. 7, 8, and 9 1116 other, which is pecu-
11111 10 two very nearly allicd genera, Fumat-ia and Entostlmdon. The first of
these exceptions is remarkable, and as far 115 Ι 61111 ascertain, not previously
described. In addition to the pair of reniform cells, similar 10 111056 01 Disso-
don, the stomata of Ortllotriclmm (llapllmmm, pulchellum, riculare, anomalum,
and capulatum have a raised hordei· of projecting cells, which form a cavity
above the stoma, fig. 4 and 5. These projecting cells have the power of con-
