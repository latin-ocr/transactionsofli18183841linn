long as the sporule (Tm. XXXIV. fig. 18.). The sheaths are not distinct, but
communicate with each othei-3 and the only point of connexion between the
sheath (there being in fact but one) and the germ is around its base close to
the sponde, so that nearly the whole of the germ is inclosed in this sbeath
(TAB. XXXIV. fig. 19‚l›.). Besides this sheath, which embraces the upper
part of the root, there is an exeeedingly delicate expansion which so closely
embraces the extremity of the root like a cap, that it is only by a careful ex-
amination that it. can be discovered (Tm. XXXIV. fig. 18, (1.). Ι am not
aware that this has ever had any connexion with the sheath through which
the root bursts, but, on the contrary, Ι believe it to be a distinct formation.
After the leaf has grown to be many times the length of the sporule, or about
two lines long, another leaf grows from the germ close to the. first, to which it
is in all respeets similar3 and then a bud begins to be developed from some
indefinite part of the germ, but like the leaves and root, from within the
sheath,which is now frequently much lacerated (ΤΑΒ. XXXIV. fig. ln). This
bud is covered hya peculial· kind ofjointed hairs, whose attachments are latei-al
at a short distance from thcir bases, and which contain a few colourless granules
(ΤΑΒ. XXXIV. fig. 19.). This bud sometimes appears after the first leaf, in
which case there is 110 second primordial leaf formed3 and is the rudimentary
stem, the first growth from it being a leaf, which exhibsts, although in a small
degree, the first evidence of gyration, and shortly after a root, which is fur-
nished with its own sheath. As I have not seen more advanced specimens‚ I
am unable to describe the succecding steps ς but as, up to this p0i11t,1ny‹;›bse1·-
vations were made upon several hundred exanlples, I may safely affirm that
the instances were sufficiently numerous for my purpose.

All the leaves after the primordial ones, or those which grow directly from the
germ, are developed ina similar manner to those of Ferns, and even the running
stem pai-takes in a slight degree of the same gyrate evolution (Tm. XXXV.
fig. 20.). The roots are all formed in sheaths, through the apices of which
they ultimately burst, the sheath continuing to embrace the base of the root,
whilst a distinct and far more delicate sheath closely embraces its point
(ΤΛΒ. XXXV. fig. 20‚b.). 'fransverse sections of the stem, root and leaves
show them all to bc. hollow, with the cavity divided longitudimdly into sepa-
rate channels. In the stem these longitudinal partitions are about fifteen or
