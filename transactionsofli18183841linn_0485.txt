IN the fourtecnth volume of the Transactions of the Linnean Society is con-
tained an interesting papcr by the Rev. W. Kirby, with the title, “ A Descrip-
tion of some Insects, which appear to exemplify Mr. william S. MacLeay's
Doctrine of Affinity and Analogy,'' wherein the reverend author points out
the confusion which has occasionally arisen in attempts made to distribute the
objects of nature according to their natural relations, in consequence of the
authors of such attempts having no clear perception of 'the distinctions which
exist between the two kinds of relations above mentioned, and therefore con-
founding them together, or even occasionally giving the higher rank to rela-
tions of analogy instead of affinity.

The object of the following remarks is still further to illustrate the theory
in question, and to show that from thc entirely relative and comparative na-
ture of these relations, founded as they both are upon more or less perfect
resemblance, two animals may at the same timo be allied together both by
affinity and analogy3 in other words, two animals may possess totally inde-
pendent relations both of affinity and analogy z thus, whilst the goatsucker and
the swallow are related to each other by analogy when we look to the class of
birds alone, we find them related together by affinity when the comparison
is made between them both as birds with the bat amongst sllammalia. In
like manner, Whilst the bat and the swallow are thus related together by ana-
logy as members of the classes Ares and Mammalia, they must be considered
to be related together by affinity as vertebrated animals when we compare
them with the dragonfly amongst the Invertebrata.
