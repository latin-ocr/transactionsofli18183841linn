Read the following “Notice of Cereus tetragonus.” By Edward
Rudge, Esq., F.L.S.

“ This plant, which has been constantly kept in my hot-house up-
wards of twenty years, is a single stem between nine and ten feet in
height from the roots. The stem next the roots and for about a foot
from thence is solid and four-Sided, about three inches in width‚
with spines at its blunt angles3 at the height of between three and
four feet it becomes pentagonous, lobcd at the angles, and within a
foot and a half of the top it is hexagonous. It first. began to bloom
in the autumn of 1836, when it put out nineteen blossoms, open-
ing soon after sunset‚ and closing again soon after sunrise. In the
autumn of 1337 it produced eleven blossoms, and in 1838 thirteen
flowers, chiefly near the top of the plant, one or two only appearing
near the lower part, but all of them growing from the angles of the
lobes and stem. The colour of the petals is white, slightly tinged
with green at the base. The anthers are yellow.''

A sketch of the flower, of the natural size, accompanied the

notice.
