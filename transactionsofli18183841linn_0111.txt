Is the opake line of elongated tissue running through the centre of
the marium, and terminating at the base of the nipple-shaped, cel—
lular process e, which is central, and opposite to the termination of
the canal b, nearly filling up the similarly shaped cavity d. la. The
nipple-shaped process from the same ovarium.

Fig. 2. The same letters have the same references. The canal h is (liminished
in diameter, but increased in length. The tissue of the stigma, and
that about the apex of the ovarium is yellow. Taken from an ovarium
before impregnation, but during expansion. 2211. Nipple—shaped pro-
cess of the same detached; it has become more conical.

Figsz. Longitudinal section of ovarium after impregnation, that is, if the
appearance of the stigma may be taken as a proos.

a. Calycine tissue; thc viscous tissue has begun to be developed.
The line h is now closed, and of a light brown colom, and d is no
longer visible, being entirely occupied by the process e: continuous
with the line Ca two curved brown lines are visible in e, the con-
vexities of which look upwards.

(I have never observed more than two lines in this species). A
lateral excavation is visible at f, the greater part of which is occu-
pied by the body g, which hangs from the nipple at the termination
of one of the curved lines.

Fig.4. Longitudinal section of a nearly ripe fruit. The viscous tissne now
occupies the chief parts of the calycine parietes, and is internally in
opposition with the now fibrous capsule, which is prolonged upwards
into four or five horns, of which two only are visible in the section.
The communication between the stigma and the cavity containing
the nipple-shaped process e, is still traceable at h. The process e,
with its two arched lines, has undergone no change. The ovulum g,
which, Ι should observe, is reduced to a nucleus, now fills completely
the excavated cavity. In the axis of the upper half the embryo is
visible in situ: it is rather excentric when compared with the axis of
the nipple. The original cotyledonary division has disappeared, ex-
cept towards its apeX.

Fig.5. Ovarium still more advanced. The letters have the same references.
