‹leny that they perform the office of spinners; an opinion 111 which they are
followed by the most eminent arachnologists of the present day. A rigorous
examination of these parts during the exercise of their function by living 5110-
eimens of Agelena labyrinthica, led me. six or seven years ago to a correct
knowledge of their external organization: a discovery which was published
111 1833 11, 111111 rcpublished in 18341.

ΤΙ10 intel-mediate spinuers, when limited to a single pair, are usually biarti-
01111110, 01111 sometimes, with the inferior 5111110015, have their basal joints con-
nected or inclosed iu a common envelope.

Spiders are stated to have two, four, or six spiuners according to the office
which the superior 0100110111ῑο 010 supposed to perform. Some obser-vers, who
believe them in every instance to be anal palpi 01· feelers, even where the ter-
miual joint is short aud the papillae 010 5111101011 at its exn-emity, assert that
all 511111015 have two or four 511111001·5; 0111015, who regard the superior 111001-
0111110 as feelers only when the terminal joint is considerably elongated and
the papillae arc arranged along its inferior surfacc, 0511111010 1110 number of
spinuers with which 511111015 are provided at two, four, or six; while those
0115011015, who admit 1110 fact that silken lines are emitted from all 1110 01001-
10111ῑο, conclude that every spider has four 01· six spiuners. Ι have already
expressed my own conviction that spiders have four, six5 or eight spinners; a
conviction induced by the recent discovery of an additional pair 0101001100]εο
in certain species.

The newly-discovered mammulae were first noticed by me about the year
1828, 011 inspecting the spinning apparatus of Clahimm att-om 3 but Ι was quite
ignorant of their true character at that 11010, and only obtained a satisfactory
knowledge of it last autumn by a patient investigation of their external struc-
ture in living· specimens. I may remark> 11101. they are 51101101, and further
removed from the anus than the other 0111010111110, being 5111101011 at the base
of the inferior intermediate pair, by which they are almost concealed when in
