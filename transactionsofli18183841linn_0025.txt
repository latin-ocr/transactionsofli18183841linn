closely 011 Trisetum among 1110 Avenacew, yet I think the linc of division is cor-
rectly drawn. On the other hand, Brachypmffum and some other plants render
very faint and obscure the separation of the Festucaceoe and deeacew.

In considering what forms a group of genera, it is necessary to determine
those points in their structure in which all, or the greater part of them agree„
in order that we may not depend for distinction 011 marks which run through
11 great many groups. This seems sufficiently obvious 111 1111 classification;
yet probably every botanist would bc able to produce examples where genera
have been founded, or species formed, 011 characters which are common to
numbers. We determine a plant to be a 611155, by its knotted culm, each knot
giving rise to a striate sheath, which terminates in a leaf of similar texture.
These leaves are generally narrow; but as there are plants with broadish leaves,
i. e. the breadth of which is as much as half their length, which every botanist
would without hesitation pronounce to be Grasses, it appears that this circum-
stance is not essential to our notion of a Grass. Another essential particular is
111 1110 flower, which is uniformly glamaeemzs, a term which 011 the present occa-
sion it cannot bc necessary to explain. Without a structure of this sort a plant
would not bc 11 611155, 1101· would it be esteemed such unless it had a single
monocotyledonous superior seed not inclosed in a capsule 01· pericarp.

These circumstances being common to all Grasses cannot be made use of
in distinguishing genera, or the tribes into which wc may incline to distribute
the genera; but there are various particular-s in the inflorescence and in the
distribution and structure of the glumes and palea, and in the organs of repro-
duction to which we can refer for this object. The inflorescence is in most
cases reputed to be too uncertain in its nature to form a good foundation for
the establishment of genera; but in 61115505, where the genera are, perhaps,
formed 111 many cases for the convenience of the student, rather than because
nature has established any marked difference between them, Ι know of no
botanist who has been able to do without it. Even the pubescence of certain
parts, a character in general of little value even 111 1110 determination of spe-
0105, 11115 been universally admitted as part of the character of a genus. If in
these cases we must take care not to push the license too far, nor 10 conclude,
because a peculiarity in some plants coincides With other circumstances, so as
to form a valuable groundwork for the separation of genera, that it must do
