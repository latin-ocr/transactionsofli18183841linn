AMONG the plants collected by M1·.Schombnrgk in British Guiana, are
two species ofa new genus allied in lnany respects to the order of Olzzcineoe3 and
in a collection from a very different quarter‚ Port Natal in South Africa, coni-
nlunicated to me by Mr. Harvey‚ are fine specimens in flower and fruit of
another new genus related to the same order, Apodyles dimidiata, named by
Ernst Meyer among Drege's plants‚ but as yet undescribed. As the deter-
1nination of these genera has led nie into some inquiry as to the affinities of
others belonging to the same group, and as they may serve in some measun¹
to throw light upon this small but curious order, I beg to offer to the Linnean
Society the aecompanying figures and descriptions, together with such obser—
vations as have suggested themselves to me.

The Olacineae were first established as a distinct order by Mi1·bel*‚ who
placed them among Polypetaloe near Amantiaceoe. Jussieu†‚ in adopting
the order, insisted upon its near relation to Sffinploceoe, near which he had
originallyss enumerated Olm‘ aniongst the “genera Sapotis affinia.” Brown
afterwards§ replied to Jussieu's objections to the affinities he had formerlyll
pointed out between Olasc and the Scmtalaceoe‚ and admitting the olacineoe as
a separate order, still concluded, never-theless, that they should he placed next
to Santalaceoe. Since that time, however, botanists do not appear generally
to have adopted that opinion; and DeCandolleffl> Wight and A1·nott**‚
