riguo. Ovulum about the same period, highly magnified‚ and cut through
longitudimdly. The included part of the tubular mcmbrane and its
origin in a cul dc sac are traceable. The exserted part is slightly
swollen. The molecules were beginning to become aggregated in
this part. and in the apex. They were all highly mobile, especially
those in the narrow portion of the membrane.

Fig. 7. Ovulum from the. placenta of an orarium just after the fall of the
pei-ianth. Iu this the filaments are seen attached to the extreme
apices, and are apparently intimately confounded with the Struc-
ture of the membranes. within the dilated apex a very distinct
vesicle or sac is visible, attached apparently by its superior mar-
gin, and containing a few mobile molecules. The appearance of
molecules in this vesiele may, and probably does result from the
presence ot' some between the vesiclc and upper surface of the tube.
Extending downwards from its inferior margin, there is a grumous
irregular process, which reaches to the dilated exserted portion. It
is broken in several places, probably from pressure. Near its apex
and adjoining the vesicle globular bodies are seen adhering, of the
nature of which l am entirely ignorant. within the dilated exserted
portion, and which is nearly trausparent (with the exception Of one
part)7 the outlines of an internal sac are visible, which appears to
taper superior-ly towards the point where it is in contact with the
grumous processa. This process Ι bave stated before to arise from
an aggregation, or rather agglutination, of the originally distinct and
active mulcentes. Within this fine cellular outline, and in juxta-
position with the apex of the ovulum, there is a cellular grnmous
body of a nearly globular form. The included portion of the tubu-
lar membraue is traceable.
