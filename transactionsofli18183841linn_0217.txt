concrete, and by a compar-ison with the proper leaves, I think there ean remaiu
no doubt of their origin. The apex ot‘ the supposed concrete 111-11010 15 1100,
111111 111 1110 mature cone overlaps the summit of the placentary region, which
is situated on the inner surface of the scale, near its apeX‚ and which at that
period is found greatly enlarged. The rapid enlargement of the plaeentary
region prevents the ovula, which are always situated on its under side, from
assuming an erect position, and they are consequently obliged to take a
downward direction3 but in no case do they form any lateral adhesion with
their axis, aud there is consequently no raphe, and the foramen and point of
attachment retain their original position; the ovula are, therefore, atropous;
and the circumstance of the foramen occupying the lower extremity of the
seed, arises from the. ovula being forced to take a downward (111-0011011 by
the. overhanging placenta. The hilum or point of attachment appears to be
placed a little obliquely on the inner base of the seed from the extension os
1110 winged border beyond it, which in this case consists of the cuticle merely
and not. ot' the entire substance of the testa. The testa 111 Cbng'feme consists
of a single integument only, the secondine of Mirbel, as Mr. Brown pointed
out many years ago; and what Ι described as a second integumeut in Pinus
bracteola and other species of the group of Silver Firs, 15 merely the cuticle of
the nucleus, which in all these specics is very conspicuous, and similarly
winged like the proper testa, which by its open apex exhibits an analogy to
the testa or cupula of Tamus.

The cotyledons in most Cong'fhrw are veiticillate, and we therefore con-
stantly observe a tendency to assume the same arrangement in the after
leaves and other organs derived from them; but from the elongation and
unequal development of the axis, the verticillate disposition is departed
from, and they most frequently exhibit a spiral arrangement. A multitude
of such spires in close 001111101, as happens in the branches of Araucm'ia 111111
111 the eones of Pinus, would of course give an indefinite appearance to the
series3 but in no case does the number of leaves in such a verticil exceed ten.
In Cupressus the cotyledons are two and opposite, and we constantly find the
after leaves opposite, the pairs crossing each other give to the leaves the
appearance of being arranged in four rows. In Gallim-is the leaves are ar<

ranged 111 fours, as in C. qzmdrivalvis and octob-alvis, and the pericarpial leaves
