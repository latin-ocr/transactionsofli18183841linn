Eyes placed on black spots on the anterior part of the cephalo-thorax:
the intermediate ones form a trapezoid whose anterior side is the short-
est3 the other four are disposed in pairs on the sides of the trapezoid,
those constituting each pair being seated on a small eminence, and con·
tiguous3 the posterior eyes of the trapezoid arc the largest, and the ante-
rior ones the smallest of the eight. Mandibles reddish brown, power-ful,
conical, armed with teeth on the inner sui-face, and slightly inclined
towards the sternum, which is beart-shaped, rough with long, erect,
black hairs, and is of a dark brown colour. Maxillae short, strong,
straight, and somewhat quadi-ate, resembling the man'dibles in colour.
Lip semicircular and prominent at the extremity, which is reddish brown.
thc base being blackish. chs and palpi long, slender, and of a reddish
brown colour, with blackish brown hands. First pair of legs the longest,
then the second, third pair the shortcst. The palpi are terminated by a
slightly curved claw. Abdomcn pointed at the extremity, very convex
above, projecting over the base of the cephalo-thorax3 it is thinly covered
with hairs, and ofa yellowish brown colour, freckled with numerous, mi-
nute, whitish spots3 along the middle extends a series of angular lines of
a brownish black hue, whose vertices are directed forwards, and whose
extremities, greatly enlarged, sorni a row of very conspicuous, irregular
spots 011 each side of the medial line, several of the anterior angles are
bisected by a fine, brownish black line 2 two longitudinal, irregular,
brownish black hands occur on each side of the abdomen, the upper one
being connected with the enlarged extremities of the angular lines by
small, confluent spots of the same hne; a large, brownish black band,
whose anterior extremity is the broadest, occupies the middle of the ab·
domen underneath, and comprises a yellowish brown medial line. Sexual
organs prominent and brownish black, except at the extremity, which is
flesti-coloured. Plates of the spii-acles pale yellow.

The male is smaller than the female, but resembles her in colour,
design, and the relative length of his legs; the absolute length of these
organs, however, is rather greater, an anterior one measuring {5}th of an
inch. Third and fourth joints of the palpi short, the former, which is the
larger, having several long, curved bristles projecting from its extremity,
