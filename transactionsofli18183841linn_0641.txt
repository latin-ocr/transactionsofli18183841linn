Cynzbocmpa. It is from three to five inches in height, of a uniform whitish
colour, but slightly tinged with purple. The root is composed of small fibres,
close to which the stem divides, somewhat dichotomously, into several creet
branches, which are sometimes flexuose; the leaves are alternate, sessile.
acute, 111-1101011110, and not quite so much adpressed as those of [ἥς-1110319811.
The terminal solitary flowers are three-fourths of an inch long3 above the ova-
rinm the tube of the perianthium narrows into a long slender form, somewhat
wideuing upwards, and the upper portion is suddenly enlarged to three times
the diameter of the lower, and marked by three roundish oblong· swellings a
short distance beneath the petals: the perianthinm is of a lilac colour, some-
what darker belowz the border being divided into six unequal erect teeth, os
which the three outer are longer and more acute, the three inner ones (petals)
being somewhat 111-0111101, more obtuse, and slightly mucronulate; they show
the markings of the a‘stivation, as described in the generic character: the
three hollow cavities corresponding with the external protuberances are fun-
nel-shaped, and terminate acutely towards the base of the tube, the margin of
their orifices being rounded and deeply notched in front, whence the stamens
proceed: this saccate tube bears some resemblance to the small saccatc fila-
ments of Dictyostega and Burmmmia, and may be supposed by analogy to
constitute part of the stamen. The filament, which appears in the emargina-
tion of the sac, is at first erect, short, round and slender, being somewhat
swollen at its apex, where it is suddenly bifurcated, its arms being divaricated
almost horizontally, and somewhat thrown back upon one. another; at their
origin they are no thicker than the simple portion of the filantem, and arc
about the same length, but. they gradually enlarge towards their summit, and
terminate abruptly each by a single anther-cell, which is adnate to it by its
back3 attached to the rear of the filament, and originating at its base, are
two membranaceous winglike appendages, joined by their inner sides just
above its bifurcation, and expanding to three times its length into a gibbous
oblong body on each side, erect, and somewhat connivent in a direction cor-
responding with the mouth of the sac: the whole stamen is of the same colour
as the pei-ianthium, but quite pale. The 111111101- 15 of a pale yellowish-white,
