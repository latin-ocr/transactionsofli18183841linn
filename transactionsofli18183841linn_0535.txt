JIJ: SmTH's Observatiom on tlte Came of Ergot. 451

to originate‚ I found the anther irregularly covered with numerous distinct,
short, simple or rainifying articulated filameuts, the articulations or side ra-
mules being of the size and form of the sporidia3 sometimes the filaments
were inore elongated and naked, or destitute of lateral sporidia. On examin-
ing a spike of Phalaris aquatica, in which the anthers had been developed,
I found their withered renlains adhering to the apex of the glumes bearing
the same kind of filaments, bnt black by exposure; they gave out the same-
shaped bodies in water, and on the glumes lower down there was a concrete
chalky-like substance entirely composed of theim but the ovarics had yet no
appearance of being ergotized, although ergots were found on other spikes of
the same plant. From the above statement I am led to consider these bodies
as the joints of a minute articulated fungus, which is developcd in the early
stage of the floret, and increases rapidkv, ultimately forming a crust‚ and
propagating itself by a total separation of the joints on the applieation of
moisture; this, no doubt, impregnates the soil or adheres to the perfect seeds
of the grass, which on germination and Subsequent growth, carry up some
of the reproductive matter of the fungus, which again developes itself in the
ant.her*‚ where it may aet with the pollen in the impregnation of the ovulum,
causing a morbid growth of the albumen, which continues to swell, and forms
an elongated oily fungoid body or ergot on which the minute fungus seems to
originate. My conclusion therefore is, that Ergot is not an organized fungus,
but the result of the action of a fungus.
