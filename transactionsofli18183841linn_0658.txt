560 slIr. SCHOMBURGK'S Accvzcnt qs the Curata,

The inflorescence 15 terminal and forms ramose spikes with a flexuose
rachis; the 1001151ῑο or spikelets are subsessile‚ lanceolam, 10050, froin one and
a half to two inches in length, and their pediccl is short and coinp1·essed*.

The whole stem is from fifty to sixty feet high; but the weight of the
numerous branchlets forces the slcnder 510111 10 (110011, and the upper part
generally describes an arch> which adds greatly to its graceful appearance„ It
resembles in its general appearance, if we do not regard the first nodeless joint,
Humboldt's Bambusa latifolia, which he found in flower 011 1110 banks of the
Cassiquiare. Ι was several times deceived, when descending the Rio Negro,
into mistaking at a distance the B. latffolia for the Curata.

l cstimated 1110 height on which we found the Garates—by which native
name I shall distinguish it‚—-at about (3000 feet above the level of the sea. I
have already observed, that the soil where it grew was very rich, the situation
was shady, and the atmosphcre humid. Its luxuriant growth in dense tufts
did not allow any other plant to shoot up under it. Its distribution is very
limited‚ and appears to 110 restricted to that chain of sandstone mountains
which extends between the second and fourth parallel, and forms the separa-
tion of waters between the rivers Parima, Merewari‚ Ventum-i, Orinoco and
Negro, Indced I succecded only in ascertaining with certainty three locali-
1105, Mounts Mashiatm Marawacca, and lVanaya.

It is a remarkable circumstance, that the plant which furnishcs the chief
ingrcdicnt for the preparation of the Urari poison 15 likewise peculial· to a few
mountainous traets3 consequently the tribes who inhabit the regions where
these plants grow, and who are acquainted with the mode of their preparation,
acquire a general importance.

In pointing out the great differences between the tropical and extra-tropical
Grasses, Schouw has noticed the much greater height which the former acquire,

000115101111111Υ assuming the appearance oftrees. Some os the most distinguished

ss The scarcity of flowering spikclets was the reason that Ι examincd only two on the spot, both of
which were only (1110-1101101011 ; 1110 floret was hermaphrodite, and 011 that 51110 of the spikelet which
was furthcst from the rachis. Of 1110 few dried specimen-s which I have brought with mc, one has
been given to Mr. Bennett, who has promised to add a notice of its characters to this paper. It would
be therefore superfluous to enter here into a detailed description of its sexual parts: I observe only

that the anthers are of a greenish yellow, and the filaments yellow.
