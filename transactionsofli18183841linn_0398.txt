big as the largest scales, chiefly confined to the tail: the mucoris pores and
lines were black.

Such are the general external characters of the Lepidosiren annectens, in
most of which it agrees with the Lepidosiren pat-adora. It is not, however,
a whit less paradoxical than its earlier described congener3 and it may be
truly said, that since the discovery of the Ornitlzorltynclzus pin-adorus there
has not been snblnitted to naturalists an animal which proves inore forcibly
than the Lepidosiren the necessity of a knowledge of its whole organizatiom
both external and internal⁷ in order to arrive at a correct view of its real
nature and affinities.

It was the reluctance to bring before the notice of zoologists an incomplete
description of this form, which has prevcnted 1ny being the original proposer
of the genus, having recorded its principul characters ns the type of a new
genus of abdominal malacopterygious Fishes in the MS. Cntalogne of the Mu-
senm of the (⁷'ollege of Snrgeons, in June 18:37, under the name of ⁶ Protopte-
⁷⁴1(ss in reference to the rudimental or enihryonic condition of the fios, and
with the specific name of (tthaillg'sbrmis as indicative of its forming· a transition

Natterer's memoir in February 15:38, rendered it necessary to substitute another
generi(- and speeific name, since the species described by that enter-prising and
scicntific traveller presented still lnore cel-like proportions.

The anatonlical details which t'ornl the snhject of the remaining part of the

nities both to the lnelnbers of that class and to the higher Vertebrate animals.
To the description of these details I now proceed.

Osseous System *Ε

The skelcton of the Lepidos-iren is partly cartilaginous, partly b0ny3 the
ossified portions are of a green colonr, like those of the Gar-pike (Belonc rul-
garis). The bodies of the vertebrae retain the primitive condition of a conti-
nuons cylindrical gelatinous choi-d, with an external ligamentons sheath†‚
except in the candal region, where they present a cartilaginons firmness, with
