case of the Camilla-as, and, therefore, cannot be justly compared to the sin-
gular structurcs erected by that animal. Ι regret. my inability to afford any
farther information upon this interestinw suhject3 but however imperfect the
description which I am at present able to give, it will at least serve to direct
the attention of future inquirers towards an animal, no less remarkable for
the apparent singularity of its external characters, than for its interesting
habits, and the geographical position which it oceupics, in common with
some of the most anomalous forins of the animal kingdom. From the ex-
treme rarity of this animal in European Musenms, as well as froin its being
unknown to all gentlemen connected with the colony of New South wales
of whom Ι have inquired concerning it, it must have disappeared from the
inhabited parts of the country; and, indeed, it may be easily imagined that
a creature of such peculiar habits, would necessarily retire before the ad-
rancc of population, more rapidly than ordinary qnadrupeds.

Genus Dmus.

The discovery of a true Jerboa on the central downs ofAustralia‚ is an event
of no small interest to the Scientific Zoologist‚ who occupics himself with the
important question of the Geographical distribution of animals. The arid
deserts of Asia and Africa, the solitary steppes of Southern Siberia, and the
boundless prairies of America, have been long known to be inhabited by
numerous species belonging to this Orthe closely allied genus of (im-hillen
in short, wherever extensive and open plains were found to exist, whether in
the Old World or in the New, there likewise were found these little two-legged
rats, hopping along or running with great velocity upon their hind legs, and
appearing as if nature had expressly intended then] to occupy such a situa-
tion. Australia alone was believed to form an exception to the general rule,
in this instance as in so many others: who will under-take to say that the
progress of discovery may not desti-oy its anomalous character in many other
instances‚ as it has done in this?

For the interesting discovery in question we are entirely indebted to Major
Mitchell; and Ι think it only due to the enterprise and ability of that merito-
rious officer, whose successful researches in the interior of Continental

Australia have had the rare merit of enlarging the bounds of science, and at
