72 sslr. GRIFHTH οη, the Development qs

viscous tissue commences, which is, even in its early stages, of a green colour.
Just after the fall of the corolla no change of any importance has taken place..
There is a greater development of the viseous tissae, and the excavation is
larger and nearly filled with broken-up tissue. The canal leading from it
appears diminished‚ but is still distinct. »Some time after the fall of the
corolla we find the excavation is considerably increased and partially oecu-
pied by broken-up fissae& The viscous tis-sue is considerably developed, and
the greater part of it contiguous to the ovarium has become of a beautifully
rich green colour.

Soon after this a small cellular body appears attached to that partos the
excavation immediater opposite to the termination of the sphaeelated line.
This is the rudiment of the. ovulum. When the fruit is about halfformed the
above parts have only undet-gone an increase in size. Both layers of viseons
tissue are well ‹leveloped‚ the green one being in intimate contaet with the
ovary. The base or termination of the sphacelated line is still distinct. The
ovulum is between cordate and ovate, its eircumference being tinged with
pink3 and it now has the appearance of albumen. Oecupying a niehe in its
centrc we observe the young embryo. It is at this¹ period totally included in
the albuminons-looking body, and is suspended by a flat cellular funiculus
froin the part of the envelope, corresponding to the termination of the sphaco-
lated line; it is among, eellular, and presents no trace of eotyledonary di-
vision †.

The subsequent changes are eonfined chiefly to the embryo. As its deve-
lopment. proceeds7 the division of the cotyledons becomes manifest, and soon
extends throughout rather more than halfof its lengthss. The funicle equals it
in length, and is as well as the embryo itself entirely cellular. As it, advances
in size the embryo censes to be oval, and appears as ifpulled out into amore
elongated form, its· base or radiele becoming at the sanie time thiekened. The
division of the cotyledons continues to be apparent for some time, bnt ceases
to be so at length from the adhesion of their contiguous faces. There is, how—
ever, always a certain degree of obliquity at their apices, which enables us to
reeal their original separation. No union takes place by their immediate
basesg&
