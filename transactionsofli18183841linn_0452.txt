376 JIJ: Hooo's Observations οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

rules, and as they are so extremely similar to those of certain species of the
Marine Sponge, which were discovered in 1825 by Dr. Grant, Ι could not
help thinking that in spite of the strong evidences which I had indisputably
obtained in favour of its vegetable nature, l had also discovered one, which
would perhaps go far in proof of its animality, and thus compel ine to be-
come soxnewhat of an unwilling believer in the monstrous theory which has
of late years been revived amongst some foreign naturalistsiffi that certain
bodies belonging to several Cryptogamous plants are at first animals, and
that after a time they change into true vegetables†. Notwithstanding the
power of locomotion has generally been accounted as one of the strongest
tests of animal life, aud that which constitutes the most obvious differem-e
between an animal and a plant, still this power is not alone confined to the
beings included in the first great division of 11ature3 for many observers have
witnessed it in subjects which pertain to, and really are membcrs of the se-
cond division, or the vegetable kingdom. Ι here allude to the extraordinary
phenomena, which have been noticed by some distinguished botanists on the
Continent, as to the locomotive powers of the seeds or sporules of certain
Coufhrrw, as well as of other plants belonging to the Algoe3 and more espe-
cially to the singular discoveries of Dr. Unger in 1826, which relate to the
spontaneous movements of the seeds of the Ectosperma clavata of Yauclierss.
The original memoir descriptive of these appearances is contained in the Act.
Acad. Nat. Curios. vol. xiii. p. 791. Bonn, 1826, with an accompanying plate.

²²< As far as I can find, Munchausen was the first author of this theory nearly half a century ago.
but he seems to have obtained few followers until very recently. For further opinions on this theory
refer to Nematoplzyte& p. 524, vol. lx. of the Dictionnaire cles Sciences Natta-elles, edit. 1830 : likewise
the articles Ne'mazoaires and Ne'mawones, at p. 365, vol. xxxiv. of the same Diclionnaz're; and the ar-
ticle Psychodiaire& p. 516 of vol. xliii. of the same work.

† This theory may be termed the ZoocarpicaL or that relating to imagiuary animal-seeds‚ Dr. Roget
writes. ··The tribe of Zoocarpia’' (certain of the Cryptoqamia Ι suppose) “produce a kind of fruit
(seed), which when detached from the parent. appears to possess powers of spontaneous motion until
the period of its taking root, and growing like a vegetable structure.” Note, p. 156. vol. i. Roget's
Bridgewater Treatise. But according to M. Bory de saint-vincent, with whom the name originated.
‘⁴ ‘les Zoocarpes' sont les se'minules animes, des veritables vegetaux ;” 1212. the live or animate seeds of
certain true plants.

ξ This plant is synonymous with the I'aucheria clm-ata of DeCandolle3 and the Conserra dilatata
ᾖ. clavata of Roth, and γ. bursam are only different states of the same.
