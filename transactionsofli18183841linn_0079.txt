depression. As the development proceedS, the cellular body, which has un-
dergone scarcely any change in shape‚ enlarges and becomes fir1ncr; at its
apex a cavity will be seen, which is partially occupied by an oblong, minute,
cellular, grumous body, the rudiment of the future embryo. This is attached
by its superior margin to the corresponding part of the apex of the cavity,
which is formed by excavation: as it continues to enlarge it extends down-
wards, and its attachment. becomes considerably narrower and very slight,
and at a rather later period it appears completely detached. As the cellular
body continues to enlarge, it becomes whiter and of a firmcr texture, and the
embryo becomes oblong and cellular, the tissue towards its apex is more
grumous and dense, and immediately above this part there is a degree of con-
striction visible. As the fruit advanccs towards maturity, the endocarp, which
has already assumed the appearance of albumen, diminishes, and the meso-
carp begins to be indurated. The cellular body is now nearly globular, white,
and of a dense texture; its component cells being loaded with granules of
fecula. The apex of the embryo now becomes lobed, indicating the com-
mencement of a cotyledonary divisi0n3 its attachment is exeeedingly fine, and
it is itself evascular. The subsequent changes in the fruit consist in a still
further diminution of the endocarp, which is subsequently reduced to a spongy
lax coating, adhering both] to the now osseous mesocarp and to the albumen⁶
The sarcocarp terminates by becoming baccate. In the seed they consist of
an enlargement of the albumen (originally the cellular b0(ly); its apiculus
finally almost totally disappearing. The division of the cotyledons incoeases,
and has reached to a considerable extent before the tissue of the radicle
becomes, as it were, condensed. The cotyledons are, during the first part of
their development, somewhat conduplicate3 they terminate by becoming· elon-
gated and plane on their internal appressed faces. The perfect radicle is
ovate, tapering to a fine point.

From this statement it will at once appear that the mode of development
of the ovula of Santalmn is different from that which usually obtainS. The
cellular oblong bodies which are attached to the placenta are evidently the
ovula, and have the appearance and cellular structure of the nuclei of ordi-
nary ovula. The membranous tube from its anatomy answers, Ι think, to the
sac of the an mos, which in ordinary structures lines the cavity formed in the
