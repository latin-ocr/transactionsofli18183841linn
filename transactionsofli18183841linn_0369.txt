ΤΗΕ interesting subject of the present. paper formed part of a small but
valuable collection obtained during a journey through the interior of 8011111-
ern Africa to the western coast, by Captain Sir Jarnes Edward Alexander, who
has recently given to the world the result of his observations on those hitherto
little known regions, and who obligingly presented to me the specimen whence
the accoinpanying drawing and description were taken, and which happened
to be the only one of the plant he collected. It was discovered by that enter-
prising traveller, growing in dry arid soil, in the open desert, called the Great
Flat or Kei Kaap, in (irent Narnaqua Land, in 25 S. latitude, and 17 Ε. 1011-
gitude. The plant was but just then iu flower, so that the fruit even in an
early state is still a desideratum. Sir ι11111105 Alexander represents it as a
thorny busli, about six feet high, with several straight, nearly simple, twiggy
stems, bearing small hoary wrinkled leaves, and white flowers. Indeed 1110
whole aspect of the plant bcspeaks the aridity of the region 111 which it
grows. .

There can be no doubt that the plant does really belong to the Bignoniaceoe,
although iu habit it bears a stronger resemblance to l‘'e›·l)e›mcere‚ especially to
Duranta and Gmelina, and, in the absence of both flower and fruit, one would
never suspect that the specimen pertained to a Bignoniaceous plant. In its
spathaceous calyx, and iu its regular sunnel-shaped corolla, the genus comes
near to Spatltoclea, but is abundantly distinguished from it by the cells of the
anthers being parallel, and connate from the middle upwards. The ovarium
I have only seen in a very young state, and I am therefore unable to say any-
thing concerning the probable condition of the mature fruit or of the seeds.

On the specimen are two fully expanded flowers and a bud. The calyx in all
