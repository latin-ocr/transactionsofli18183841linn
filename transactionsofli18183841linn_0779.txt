Mr. BENTHAM'S Accozmt of two new Genera allied to Olacineae. 675

another in the cell; the placenta adheres to the side of the cavity next to the
excentrieal style. In Pogopetalwn the ovules are placed as in Apodytes, but
there are three cells, not radiating from the centre of the ovary, but diverging
from the side next to the excentrical style.

In Ximenia‚ Sclzoepfia, and several species of Olam the ovules taper into a
long point, which before fecundation is curled upwards in Xinzenia. ln
Heisteria they are long and slightly thickened at the extremity. In other
species of Olasc they are ovate. In Opilio and Camjera they are very mi-
nute, and look like a hooked point to the placenta. In Apodytes, Leretia
and Pogopetalum they are short and broad, and remarkably cellular in their
texture.

The fruit (which Ι have only seen ripe in Heisteria, Olaoe, Sclzoelgfia, Canfferaez
and Apodytes, and unripe in Pogopetalmn, but which has been described from
ripe specimcns also in Ximenitt, Heisteria‚ Opilia and Gomplzsmdra, and from
unripe ones in Icacina) is a drupe with a thiu, fleshy, or sometimes nearly dry
pericarp and a crustaceous or osseous putamen, which is almost always one-
celled and one-seeded by abortion. It is generally of an oblong, ovoid, or
nearly globular form, but of a very remarkable, almost kidney shape, in Apo-
ἀμίας, with a fleshy protuberanee from the hollow side.

The seed, of the same form as the drupe, fills the cell; the testa is of ex-
ceeding tenuity‚ and indeed, in many specimens I have opened, it ean scarcely
be distinguished from the albumen, which fills the seed and is of a fleshy or
somewhat cartilaginous consistence. In its axis is a narrow cavity‚ at the
upper end of which (that is, in relation to the fruit) is a straight embryo,
usually very short, with a short radicle pointing upwards (with relation to the
fruit), and ovate or oblong cotyledons. The plumula is inconspicuous. In
Olaoe, Heisteria, Sclzoepfia and Cansjera, and probably also in Ximenia and
opilia, the placenta becomes combined with the seed, and assumes the form
of a thin cord or mere furrow up one side. The seed then becomes to all
appearance erect, attached by a broad umbilicus at the base, the embryo being
at the opposite end, although, physiologieally speaking, the broad umbilicus Is
the base of the placenta, and the real hilum is the extremity of the cord or
furrow at the opposite end. This structure is plainly indicated in Gaertner’s

figure of Olax scandens (Carpol. Suppl. p. 119. t. 201.), but appears to have been
