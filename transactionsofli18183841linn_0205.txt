THE Cong‘ferce undoubtedly constitute one of the most interesting families
in the vegetable kingdom, whether considered in connexion with the former
vegetation of the earth, or in reference to their peculiarities of structure, or as
objeets of utility, affording to man an abundant supply of valnable materials
employed extensively in the arts and domestic oeconomy. Their habitanti strue-
ture are so peculial· that they have been rauked as a separate family by the
earliest writers on Systematic Botany. Richard iu his valuable work, “ Me-
moires sur les Coniferes et les Cyeadees‚” has distributed the family into three
groups, denominated by him, from the typical genera of each, Ahietinew, Cu-
pressinece, and Tau-inem the first may be characterized by their female spikes
forming a cone or strobilus‚ their ovula being in pairs, and by their sealy buds ;
the second by their reproductive orgaus having a tendency to become inde-
finite, by their naked buds, and other peculiarities of habit3 the third by their
female spike being usually reduced to a single flower, with a solitary, com-
pletely naked ovulum, whose external integument assumes a fleshy consist-
ence and resembles an arillus. All three will be found to correspond remark-
ably in the structure of their male flowers; and the differcnces presented by
their female inflorescence arc more apparent than real, for they eonsist rather
in the degree of reduction of parts than in actual structure. Their orgaus of
nutrition present a remarkable degree of uniformity in their structure, and,
indeed, it would be diffieult to point out a family so completely natural, and
one whose groups pass so insensibly into each other.

To the three gron ps above mentioned I propose to add a fourth, which may be
named Avonam-inere, and to consist of Araucaria, Damnem-a, aud perhaps Cem-
ninglzamia, which correspond with Cupressz'nece in the tendency of their repro-
ductive organs to become indefinite, in their naked buds, and in their general
habit. This group being mutually related to „lhietineoe and (ww-ossium, would
