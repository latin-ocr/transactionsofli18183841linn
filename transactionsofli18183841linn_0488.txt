eyes I have also given a careful representation of the maxilla and the ante-
rior tibia, showing the peculiar construction of the subapical noteh ; and have
added a figure of the under-side of the head with the various organs insitu,
from which it will be 56611 that there is a curved elevated line across the
middle of the produced eentral part supporting the mentum, but I very much
doubt whether there be any actual articulation at this place. On each side
of this central part is a deep impression, having an elevated ridge running
down the middle, forming two deep canals on each side, the interior of which
serves for the aetion of the base of the maxilla, whilst the external forms a
fossula for the eoneealment of the antenna when withdrawn beneath the
head.

In the “Iconographie des Coleopte1·es” of Messrs. Dejean and Boisduval
(vol. i. p. 176) a genus was proposed under the name of Aoeinwlzorus, consist-
ing of two speeies, A. Laco›·‹lai1-ei and A. Lecontei, the former inhabiting
the vieinity of Rio Janeiro, and the latter North Ameriea. In the Supplement
to the Species General, Dejean having ascertained that this new genus was
identieal with Psemlmnorpha as well as with the genus Dmpanus, indicated
only by Illiger in the sixth volume of the “ Magazin der Ent01nologie” (p. 344),
republished his descriptions of the :la‘inoplzori under the generie name of
l)repanns‚ giving A. Lecmztei as probably identieal with Pseudomorplza θα*-
fraciam, Κ. 011 comparing the figure given of A. Lecontei 111 the Icono-
graphie with the authentis: specimen of Powualommplza erret-aelam, now in the
‹vlla-tion of the Entomtdogieal Society‚ it is unquestionable that they are
speeifieally identieal, so that the name Lecontei must sink into a synonym;
and in like manner I feel disposed to preserve the generic name proposed by
Mr. Kirby in preference to that merely indicated by Illiger.

In the first part of the Transactions of the Entomologieal Society‚ a still
more remarkable inseet was described by the Rev. F. W. Hope, under the
name of fldelotopus Qut-immas, being doubtfully placed in the family Gyri-
m'dw, with the observation: ‘⁶ This singular insect was sent to me from the
swan River Settlement in New Holland. It seems to unite in itself the
characters of several families. From the tarsi it is referrible to the Penta-
›nm-(13 whilst its general appearance and clavate antennae place it amongst
the Nem-oplmga. By its subeontractile legs (for the bent tibiae are not en-
