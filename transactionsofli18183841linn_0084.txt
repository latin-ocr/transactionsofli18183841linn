attachment of this is visible hyan expanded portion at ιι, and no
change is seen to have taken plaee froin this part to the origin of
the tube. Two grumous irregular masses are visible between the
apex of the ovuluin and the attachment. of the unchanged portion
of the tube. 'she still inore enlarged exserted portion, and rathe.
inore than the lower half of the tube, have beeoinc eeHular, the cells
containing a good deal of grunwus matter. The upper part of the
tube likewise appears cellular; but this,1 think, results srom the ad-
hesion of the cells of the surfaee of the placenta. On oue side of the
apex of the tube a protuberancc is seen3 the only instance that has
hitherto occurred.

To its apex a filameut is seen adhering, aud this part is of a yel-
lowish brown colour. The vesicle is not visible. Three small cel-
lular-looking bodies are seen within the apex. l should remark, that
the edges of the upper finely-cellular portion of the tube appeared

to be double.
