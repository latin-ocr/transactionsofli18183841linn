and maxillae being the browncst. Legs and palpi red-brown. First and
fourth pairs of legs, which arc the longest, equal in length, third pair the
shortest. Abdomen oviform, thinly covered with hairs, convex above,
projecting over the base of thc cephalo-thorax3 it is browuish black.
Plates of the spiracles very dark brown.

The male is rather darker than thc female, and the anterior part of the
cephalo-thoraX, which is elevated and tmncated, has numerous short hairs
011 its summit. On this summit, also, the eyes are distributed in pairs:
one pair, situated on its posterior part, forms with another, on its anterior
margin, an elongated trapezoid, whose front side is considerably the short—
est3 the two other pairs are disposed on the latcral margins, the eyes con-
stituting each being contiguous3 the anterior eyes of the trapezoid are
much the smallest of thc eight. The sexes differ, likewisc, in the relative
length of their legs, the posterior ones of the male, which measure &th
of an inch, excecding the anterior ones a little in longitudinal extent.
The palpi are dark-coloured; the second joint is clavate, and has a small,
pointed apophysis on the inner side, at the base; third and fourth joints
moderately long3 the lattcr projccts a large apophysis from its anterior
extremity, which curves outwards and rather upwards in front of the fifth
joint; it is somewhat enlargcd at its termination, and has a pointed pro-
cess on the outer side; a small, obtuse apophysis occurs, also, on the
under side of the fourth joint3 thc fifth joint is oval, convex and hairy
externally, concave within, comprising the palpal organs, which are highly
developed, complicated in structure, very prominent, with a strong, curved,
blank spine at the superior part, and a fine, convoluted one on the outer
side, near the extremity, resembling in form the human ear, contiguous
to which, on the under side, is a slightly curved, pointed, projecting pro-
cess. The colour of these organs is red-brown.

Specimens of llizlckenae'rct humilis were discovered in October 1836, under
slates, in the garden belonging to T. lVarner, Esq., of Crumpsall Green, near

Manchester3 and others were obser-ved afterwards on rails at Crumpsall
Hall.
