Mr. BLACKWALL'S Descriptions ‘f new Species of Spiders.

eyes of the anterior row are the largest of the eight. Abdomen short,
broad, thickly covered with hairs, soinewhat larger at the posterior than
the anterior extremity, oonvex above, projecting over the base of the
cephalo-thorax: it is of a very (lark brown colour, approaching to black,
the under part being the palest; along the middle of the upper part
extends a series of very obscure, angular lines of a lighter hue, whose
vertices are directed forwards; and on each side of the anterior part,
near its union with the cephalo-thorax, there is a blackish spot of an
oval form. Spinners yellowish red, arranged in a transverse row inune-
diately below the anus, the exterior ones, which are the longest, are
trial-ticulum, and bave the papillae or spinning-tubes disposed along the
inferior surface of the terminal joint. Plates of the spiracles yellowish
white.

The male is rather smaller than the female, which it resembles in
colour, and in the relative length of its lcgs; the absolute length of the
organs of progression, however, is greater, a posterior leg measuring
-lssgths of an inch. The second joint of the palpi has a cui-ved, pointed,
yelloxvish red process on the under side, near the middle3 third and
fourth joints sllort; the former is much the larger, very gibbous above,
and has a small, pointed, blackish apophysis near its extremity on the
outer side ς the latter has a strong, blackish apophysis at its extremity on
the under side, which is directed upwards, its curved point being in eon-
tact with the sniall apophysis of the third joint; fifth joint oval, mode-
rately eonvex and bairy externally, concave within, comprising the palpa!
organs; they are highly developed, not very complicated in structure,
vascular, surrounded by a filiform, black spine, and are flesh-coloured.
The convex sides of the terininal joints of the palpi are directed froin,
and the palpal organs towards each other.

This species, which resembles Tarm-111· agilis in the relative length of its
legs, is found under stones in moist pastui-es near Llanrwst in Denbighshire.

The males have the palpal organs completely developed in the month of
August.
