Fig. 6. Ovuluni a little more advanced, (letached with the nipple-shaped pro-
cess, the brown curved lines of which were in this instance no longer
visible; the process is rather papillose at its apex,

Fig. 7. Ovarium still lnore advanced. The excavation has become much en-
larged3 the ovulum g has now attained a considerable size, and has
become nearly central. The commencenient of its development up-
wards into horn-shaped processes is visible atga.

tion.

Its apex is of a light brown colom-2 communicating with the lower
parts of the curved lines is an obscure channel, the edges of which
appear of a light brown. This appearance of a channel of commu-
nication between the apex of the nipple-shaped process, to which,
probably, the male influence is applied, did not appear to be uni-
versal or even general. A vesicle filled with brown grumous gra-
nules is seen attached to the lower part of one side of the process by

a broad base.

Fig: 2. Nipplc-shaped process, with the centra] opake line dissected out. The
two curved lines arc very conspicuous, and of a rather deep-brown
colour. The apex appears papillose. The broad cellular, irregular
portion visible on one side indicates the site of attachment of an
omilim).

a narrower base, and is evidently cellular.

Fig. 4. Ovnlum at about the same period of development3 the attachment is
very narrow: at the colnlnencement of the narrow portion, and in

its centre‚ a globular vesicle is just visible; this is, I imagine, the
