IN following out any branch of natural history, the attentive student is con-
stantly struck with the host of unexpected analogies which meet him on every
side. He is not surprised to find a complicated network of relations, whether
of analogy or affinity, iu his own particular department, but though his know-
ledge ont of that is but superficial, he is astonished at observing how many
analogies present themselves, which at first, perhaps, he is inclined to think
fanciful or scarcely worth notice, hut their number and importance increase
on him so fast, that at length he is forced to acknowledge the fact, that pecu-
liarities of form, structure, colouring‚ διο. are represented by similar peculiari-
ties in other apparently but little related orders.

It is most curious, for instance, to find the different organs of which the
more perfect plants are composed represented by various minute Algae and
Fungi, a circumstance, to which, perhaps, is owing the great success which
has attended the physiological researches of various close obser-vers or students
of Cryptogamic plants, as Link, Mirbel, Mohl, Meyffl, &c., and which has
caused Agardlff, in perhaps rather too exclusive terms, to call the attention
of all inquii-ers into the more intimate structure of phaenogamous plants to his

own favourite department of science†.

† As an instance of this, the analogy between the helices of spiral vessels and the flocci or sporidia

of HelicomyceS, Helicosporium and Helicon-iebant, pointed out by Kunze in his Mycoloqisclze Heste, may
be mentioned. It might be objected, that the articulations of the plants in question differ from any-
thing in spiral vessels; but it is very cnrious that Meyen (Neues Syst. Pflanz. Phys. vol. i. tab. 4, fig. S.)
has lately discovered articulated helices in the cells of Oncldium maximum. Here an analogy recog-
nized between the fungi in question and the helices of spiral vessels might, if considered attentively‚
have been an index of the probability of the existence of articulated helices in some phaenogamous
