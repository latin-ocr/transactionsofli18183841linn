Mr. Woons οη the Genera (gf Europemz Grasses. 35

Glumes nearly equal, membranous. Paleae of cqual length, membranous„
the outer much the hroadest, and embraeing the other.

2. Dactyloctenimn. Spikes fingered3 spiculae many-flowered: inner glume
mucronate. Paleae unequal, the outer ventricose³ membranous ς the inner
scariose.

3. Leptoclzlmz. Spikes in a raeeme. Spiculae 2- or many-flowercd. Glumes
keeled. Outer palea keeled, 3-nerved. Awn straight.

4. Beck-mannia. Spikes in a raceme3 spiculae 1—3-flowered. Glumes equal,
deeply navicular, quite obtuse, and enlarging towards the apex. Palem
membraneus, less firm than the glume, awnless.

5. Spartina. Spikes npright, in a raceme. Glumes very unequal‚ the inner
large, acuminum, and almost including the solitary floret. Palcae un—
armed, membr-anons, but less firm than the glunic, the outer retuso.
Styles united.

The single floret seems to bc the principal distinction between CYNoDoN
and Chloris. There is no European species of this latter genus. DAc'rYLooTE
NIUM agzsptiacanz, Willd„ the only specics with which I have any concern, was
considered by Linnzcus as a Qflammwm and, in fact, these two genera may
be taken as the connecting links which unite the Chloridem and Festucaceoe.
Michaux ranked it. as Chloris, to which its fingered spikes give it a consider-
able resemblance. It is said by Steudcl to be the Cenem-110· [egyptius of Lin-
naeus. Lainarck placed it with Eleusine. Walter (Carolim) with *Egilopa At
last Wilidenow established for this and one or two more species a new genus
with a bad name, which Ι have not presumed to alter. ΒΕΟΚΜΑΝΝΙΑ is inserted
by Kunth among the Phalarideag but it has no trace of an external imperfect
floret, and the structure of the flower, as well as the one-sided spikes‚ point
out its strong affinity with Chloris. SPARTINA is the only genus whose position
is doubtful, yet the description approaches nearly to that of Cgsnodon.

AVENACEAE.

The necessary insertion of the Arumlinaceoe and Chloridem has somewhat
inter-rupted the natural series which might pass from Stipa to Arena. All the
genera have glutines, which are scariose on the margin (except in Gaudinin),
