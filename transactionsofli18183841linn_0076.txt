voyage, in the Appendix to vol. ii. p. 569, that the ovula are attached to the
apex of a central receptacle, must therefore be received with slight. limi-
ration.

The ovula in this genus have, Ι believe, in general a marked correspondence
in number with the stigmata, the number of both being most commonly three.
ln the very young buds, aS, sor instance, those of a line in length, the future
ovula are indicated by papilliform bodies of a homogeneous pulpy structure.
They are, as it were, appressed to the surfaee of the placenta 3 they soon, how-
ever, become elongated, and appear truncate at the apex, which is minutely
papillose. The next change takes place apparently with great rapidity, and
consists in the protrusion of a tubular membrane from the eentre of the apex
of the ovillum, in which no opening could be detected previously. This tubu-
lar membrane passes down at first 111 the direction of thc axis of the ovuhnn,
but becomes immediately reem-ved, and passes up on one side of the ovulum,
aud in close apposition to the placenta.

Ι have not hitherto seen this membrane in the earlier stages of its formation.
At the period to which I have alluded above, the tabe may be traeed to the
point of attachment of, or base of the ovillum, where it ends, or rather beginS‚
’111 a cul de sac. Immediately at its exit it is somewhat enlarged, but the
diameter soon narrows, and continues so until it dilates again at the apeX,
which frequently shows a tendency to division. 'I‘hroughout the ascending
part of its course it is 111 close apposition with the placenta. Generally each
tube reaches to the apex of this body3 and at this point, and occasionally
throughout other portions‚ mutual and tolerably firm adhesion takes place.
Each tube is a simple, nlenlbrauollS, closed sae, containing a great number of
molecules, which are exceedingly active, especially about the time of expan-
sion of the flower. These molecules vary much 111 size, the variety depending
apparently upon degrees of combinatum, the very small ones being alone
simple. The motion consists of a rapid oscillati0n‚ and is frequently accom-
panied with considerable change of place 3 the molecules frequently approach-
ing each other [ad then reeeding, the linc or course which they describe
being very irregular. The motion is much more vivid in those parts of
the tubes in which the least aggregation of the molecules has taken place.

'l'hese always appear to be least abundant in that part of the tube contained
