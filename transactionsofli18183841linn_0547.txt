methods there at last is formed a moniliform filamont, which, though simple
in its origin, ultimately becomes branched‚ the branchlets most commonly
having a centrifugal development, 1·adiating²’‘< from a central collection of
cellules, and giving off innumerable jonas, which become perfect sporidia
(Tm. XXXIII. B. fig. 9. and 10), which commence again the several methods
of germination just detailed.

These grauules appear important bodies, resembling probably the nature of
tho nuclei, which were first discovered by Mr.B1·own in the cells of various or-
gam, and since called cgstoblasts by Schleiden in his description of Phytogene-
sis ; and these different methods of germination afford good illustrations of the
manner of the formation of cellular tissuc; and occasionally it happens that
three of the methon viZ. pullulation, division, and the omission of tubes
from the spol-idm, may be detected in different parts of one little plant at the
same time, as in 'rim xxxin. B. fig. 9.

Whilst witnessing the daily increase and manner of development of this
singular plant5 an extreme number of green granules alone presented them-
selves, which had collected into one spot near the upper edge of the glass on
which they were placed, and probably from being different in specific gravity
from the water, had so collected by the glass having been kept in a position fa-
vourahle for their so doing. These granules were about the ffi-ffth part of an
inch in diameter, and possessed the movements of “active molecules‚'' which
was of greater range in proportion to their size than that observed in the spo-
ridia before mentioned. On applying the highest magnifying powers it was
found that these granules were similar to those in the interior of the sporidia‚
and sometimes were seen singly, at other times two united, and in a few cases
three connected in a line, as at. (ΤΛΒ. XXX111.B. fig. ll.). Being at a loss to
conceive how these granules could escape from the body containing them,

* The radiating and moniliform character observed in this little plant, I consider is particularly owing
to the manner in which it has been caused to grow; for being covered by a piece of mica, the sporidia
or joints as they have formed have not been exposed to any cause likely to disturb thc slender union
they have with each other: and in this way they assume a condition which is unnatural, as on the
erg-ot the articulations are scarcely ever found combined. I have noticed the same fact with Tor-ula
eerevisioe, which has been made to grow without being disturbent, when a long string of sporidia could
be scen, and with a slight agitation of the liquid not more than two or three could be afterwards found

united.
