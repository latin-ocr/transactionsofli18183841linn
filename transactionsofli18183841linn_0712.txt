Gen. ERGA'rls.

Oculi subaequales‚ in seriebus 2 transversis in antica cephalo-thoracis parte
positi3 seriei utriusque intermedii quadram referentes,laterales fere con-
tigui in tuberculis oblique positi. Mamillio mediocres, labium versus
declinatae, basi convcxae, apice rotundatae, intus plus quam extus abrupte
curvatae. Lahiam subtriangularc. Pedes breves, mediocres3 pari lmo
longissimo, dein 2do, 3tio brevissimo. Tarsi triunguiculati ; unguibus :2
superioribus curvatis pectinatis‚ inferiore prope basin inflexo.

Ergutis benigna. (Theridion benignum, Walek. Hist. Nat. des Aran. livr. ν,
pl. 8. fig. l. Drassas parvulus, Blackw. Rcsearch. in Zool. p. 337. Dic-
tynna benigna, Koch, Die Arachniden, b. iii. p. 27. tab. 83. fig. 134—5.)

Ergasis latens. (Dictynna latens, Koch, Die Arachn. b. iii. p. 29. tab. 83.
fig. 186.)

Ergutis viridissima. (DJ-assus viridissimas, Walek. Hist. Nat. des Insect. Apt.
t. 1. p. (331.)

In addition to the above-named species, it Is probable that the Drassus
flavescens of Kummer might be included in the genus Ergutis³ as it appears,
from the description given of it by M. Walckenaer (Histoire Mutia-elle (les In-
sectes Apteres, tome i. p. 6:32), to have a close relation of affinity with Ergatis
viridissim3 but it would be precipitate to place it among the Cingflonidw
before it, has been proved to possess the essential characters of that family.

When my attention was first directed to Ergutis benigna, in the autumn
of 1832, I supposed it to be new to arachnologists, and described it in the
London and Edinburgh Philosopliical Magazine‚ vol. iii. p. 437—S‚ under the
appellation of Cluhimm parvula. Soon after, having had an opportunity ot·
comparing this spider with specimens of Ergutis viridissima received from
the continent, Ι transferred it to the genus Drassus, with the Plzytwlzilw, to
which genus it appeared to be allied (Researches in Zoology, p. 337). At
this period I was not aware of its specific identity with the leeridion benignum
of M. VValckenaer‚ and Ι am quite unable to comprehend why so accomplished
and discriminating an observer should still persist in separating it from the
forms with which it is most intimately connected by its organization and
oeconomy.
