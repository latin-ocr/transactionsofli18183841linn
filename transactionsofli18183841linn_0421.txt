want the pancreatic caeca, the analogy which Lepido-siren offers to one genus
in that group, Bdwze, in the elongated slender form of the body and its green
bones, is not without interest.

In the low condition to which the pectora} and venti-al fins are reduced,
the zoologist who deals merely with external characters would see. in the
Lepidosiren a transitional form between the abdominal and apodal groups of
the lllalacoptetygil. But by far the most important affinities which a deeper
research into the organization of the Lepidosiren brings to light, are those to
the higher Cartilaginous Fishes which are indicated by the semiossified con-
dition of its skeleton; by the removal of the acoustic labyrinth from the cavity
into the parietes of the skull3 by the number of branchial al·ches; hythe sim-
plicity of the maxillary apparatus; by the spiral intestinal valve; and, above
all, by the condition of the ovidncts as distinct tubes with two separate aper-
tures.

From every group of Fishes, however, the Lepidosiren is sufficiently distinet
to form the type not merely of a genus, but of a family3 and, in the natural
system, it forms a link connecting the higher Cartilaginous Fishes with the
Sauroid genera Polypterus and Lepiclosteus; and at the same time makes the
nearest approach in the class of Fishes to the Perennibranchiate Reptiles.
