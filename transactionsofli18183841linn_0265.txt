IN Sir dames Smith's English Flora (ii. 25.) it is observed that the flowcrs of
Cascam carolum are “ in all the British specimens as well as in Ehrhart's
German ones destitute of scales in the throat of the tube (of the corolla),
which Dr. Hooker confirms, in contradiction to thc opinion of our learned
friend Mr. Brown, who possibly exa111incd specimens of C. epithfflnmn, some
of which often approach the eut-optma in size.'' Mr. Brown's words (Prodr. 491.)
ure, ‘⁶ squamae in C. europam et monogyna certe ext1u1t.''

These conflicting statements led 111e to examine fresh specimens of the plant
referred to, (gathered at Sompting in Snssex, in company with M1·.Borrer‚
who was fully satisfied of its being the true C'.e1‹r‹›poea‚) and Ι have great
pleasure in confirming the observation of Mr. Brown. The fact of these
scales having been overlooked by Smith and Hooker is easily aceounted for
by their lying quite close to the corolla, their perfect transpareney, and very
minute size. They are, indeed, so difficult of detection as not to have been at
first noticed by Mr. Borrer and myself, even when examining fresh specimens,
and it is scarcely possible to discover them in flowers that have been dried.

Upon referring to the different authors who have described this plant, Ι find
that the presence or absence of scales is frequently passed over without any
notice 2—That Pei-soon, Host and Besser (Pl-im. Fl. Gallicize „lus-tr.) say that
they do not exist; Reichenbach describes and figures them as ‘⁴ palmato-
subsexfidis ;'' Gaudin sayS‚ ‘⁶ in iconibus Sturmii, Schkuhrii et Eng. Bot. fila-
menta male depicta fuerunt. Squamae enim utique, scd segre conspicuae ad<
sunt;'' and by Bluffand Ffflgcrhuth, in their Qnd edition, they are said to be
“erectis adp1·essis.” This last description agrees with that of Mei-tens and
Koch, whose words are, ‘⁶ unssecht, aiig·e(l1·iicl{t‚” ercet. and adpressed. Roemer
