Dr. Blume makes no mention of petals in 1115 generic character3 but as
they certainly exist in the Iudian species, I have included a notice of them in
a parenthesis. This genus will be seen to differ but little from But-mannia,
except. in the separation of the dissepiments from the periearpium, which is
hence enabled to split from wiug to wing, transversely upon each face, pre-
senting three widely-gaping apertures ; and as 1110 (1155011111101115 110001110 almost
wholly contracted upon the central column, there results a clear passage across
the capsule from one opening to the other: hence the meaning of the term
“capsula fenestrata.” From what Ι have elsewhere shown relative to the
structure of the walls of 1110 capsule in Burmauniaceous plants‚ it will be easy
to conceive the origin of this pcculiar kind of dehiscence. In like manner as
in But-mannia. owing to the complete 111110011011 of the margins of the carpels
into one central axis, the placentie are thrown into a position alternating with
111011 normal oue, and are consequently placed upon the axile line in the 1111101·
angle of the cells, opposite to the. wings of the perianth, and of course opposite
to the sepals. This explains the meaning of Dr. Blume's expression, ‘⁶ recep-
tacula augulis perianthii opposita, scuiibifida‚” a definition which exactly applies
to Bar-mannia 11150.

Of the Brazilian plants I am about to describe, the first 51100105 was found
by me in the neighbourhood of Rio dc Janei ro in April 1837, and then named
Dicqflmtega orolmnclz[nieles3 not long after which Mr. Gardner sent specimens
to Eugland 111 1110 (lried state, gathercd from the same spot. I had good oppor-
tunities of examining this in a living state, and of making drawings and details
of it as well as of the other species which were subsequently found.
