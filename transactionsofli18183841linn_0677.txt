upon the Leaqua Plant belonging to the order Ochnaccze. 577

The discovery of the exuviae in some of them, in addition to a mieroseopic
examinatiom placed it beyond all doubt that Ι had before me the productiori
of an inscct.

Twenty or more individuals are produced on the same leaf (in that before
me twenty-three), the uppcr sui-face of which is furnished with a strong shining
cuticle. As soon as the presence of the grul) has caused the tissue imme-
diately around it to swell, and to detach itsclf above and below, by a sort of
concentration, from the cutiele, there is an evident attempt, as it enlarges7
exactly as in AEcidiam cancellatmn and other allied epiphytal Fungi, to burst
indifferently through either surfacc, but, apparently, it is in general unable
to overcome the superior resistance of the upper cuticle, though that. is
somewhat raised and occasionally a little ruptured‚ and consequently forces
its way through the hypophyllous cuticle‚ splitting it into a few subacute
laciniae.

Each gall is cylindrical‚ about a line long, and consists of two distinct sub-
stances, the outer of which is dark brown, and evidently a continuation of the
inner substance of the leaf3 the inner much paler, thinncr, shining and horny,
as is indeed the ease in many galis. The apex is strongly umbilicate with the
border, which is formed of the outer cont, slightly expanded, and furnished
with a few shallow, obtuse, distinet crenulations. At the bottom of the um-
bilicus is a nipplclike operculum. The operculum is solid and formed of the
onter cont, but is intimately connected with the top of the inner horny sae,
which is very thiu above, and thus forms a lid to it, which fits on exactly
where the outer suddenly divergcs from the iuner coat‚ so that little resistance
is offered to the egi-css of the inscet, except that of the upper portion of the
inner eoat, which, as said above, is extremely thiu, and, at the point where the
operculum fits οη, very brittle. There is sometimes a little punctiform de-
pression at the top of the operculum, which is probably the sear of the punc-
ture made by the ovipositor of the insect. Seventeen of the galls were already
burst; and out of the remaining six, one only furnished an imperfect grub.
and this being exceedingly light and dry, was unfortunately lost whilst the
drawing was in progress. Several of the other galls had the remains of exuviae,
but too imperfect to furnish any information. I am not aware that there is
any instance on record of a gall bursting through the cnticle; and the oper-
