Mr. BABINGTON on Cusouta epilinum and halophyta. 565

Since the reading· of this paper Ι have gathered Cascam epilinum among flax
both in the county of Mayo and in Argyleshire, and add a description drawn
from living speeimens.

Segments of the calyx 5, ovate, attenuated above into an acute point, very
fleshy, with peculial-ly large cells ; some of them often so much thiekened
as to become deltoid. Tube of the corolla l} times as long us the limb,
slightly inflated, the lobes triangular acute3 stamens inserted very near
to the summit of the tube; filaments short; anthers cordate3 the limb
of the eoi-olla is osten very fleshy. Seales bifid, each lobe either entire οι·
2- or 3-f1d‚ short. Styles 2, short, bent round each other. Braetes not
always present, broadly ovate, obtuse, with a minute point, often pur-
plisli. Flowers wliitish-yelloxv, sometimes tinged with pink. Anthers
bright yellow.

Ι have reason to believe that this plant is not a native of the British Isles‚
but that it has been, and continues to be, introduced with the flux-seed from
Odessa and other ports of Southern Russia. Flax raised from American, and
also, Ι believe, Riga seed, is free from this destructive parasite.
