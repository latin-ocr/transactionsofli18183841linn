and even retained their activity. Alcohol appears to produce no other effect
on the granules, except the immediate suspension of their motion. Iodine acts
upon the larger ones, which it changes to a bluish coloni-3 but it produces no
very obvious effect on the lesser ones, except rendering them more distinct.

1 have found both these kinds of granules in the unripe thecae of Feras, of
L'tscopodium and of ophioglossum: in the latter the larger ones are spherical,
very numerous, and some of them very large; the whole of the cells of the
theca are filled with them in the immature state of the spore⁷ but they arc
mostly absorbed during its maturation, and very few remain after the dis—
charge of the spores from the theca. Active granules exist also in some (if
not all) the lower tribes of Cryptoganlous plants: Ι have found them in the
unripe thecae of Mosses and of several species of szgermamzia, in the apo-
thecia of Liclzens, and in the lamellae of Agariffl, and the perithecia of some
other Fzmgi: in some Agat-irs they are so minute as only to be rendered visible
under a high magnifying power by diluting the water with iodine. On coni-
paring these granules with those contained in the unopened anthei-s of flowcr-
ing plants, they appear to me to be iu every respect identical; in both cases,
where the larger ones occur, they are similarly acted upon by iodine, and are
therefore probably of the same nature; in the theca they appear to occupy a
similar place with those in the cells of the anthers‚ and they decrease in like
manner during the progress to maturity of the pollen-grain and of the spore.
In the granular contents of the spore also there is the most perfect resemblance
to those of the pollen-grain& Perhaps the most obvious difference is in the
entire absence of green colour from the fluid of the latter.

It has been already observed, that while the changes which have been
described are in progress in the spore and its integument, considerable
changes are also produced in the organization of the theca. ΤΑΒ. XXXIX.
fig. 1 & 2. represent two sides of that organ in its immature state, and as it
appears up to the time when the spores which it contains are in the state
represented at ΤΑΒ. XXXIX. fig. lO. At this time it is a thin, transparent,

* In the manner in which the spores of Equisetum, Ophioqlossum, Psilotum, and perhaps all the
higher tribes of Cryptogamous plants, originate in their thecae, there is a strong resemblance to the
origin of pollen in the antherae as described by Brougniart, namely‚ “ in the interior os the cells of a

single and distinet cellular masS.''
