390 sllr. Hooo's observatiam on the Spongilla fluviatilis,

first called to them by seeing some little extraneous substances floating in the
water and being carried by the stream setting in directly to a particular part
of the Sponge. With a good magnifier Ι then clearly perceived not only this
current in action³ but. likewise another flowing from the canals through their
large orifices or oscules, and bearing along with it small ejectamenta or
brownish bits of the Sponge or of soil, which I frequently observed turning
over and over, and sometimes kept by the currents in a revolving motion within
the oscules, and thereby undoubtedly showing that certain flowings or streams
were taking place in the water. I have further established the presence of
them by putting a fresh specimen of the Spongillafluviatilis in a dish of
water and sprinkling a little calcined magnesia on the surface3 this powder
soon exhibited motions, and betrayed by its being carried round and round
upon the water in different directions, that strong and distinct currents were
aetively going on. After many minute examinations in endeavouring to solve
the cause of these phaenomena, Ι have hitherto invariably found a worm or an
inser-t, or some crustaeeous 01· molluscous animal, concealed within the Sponge,
and by which the eui-rents were actually produced.

A parasitical insectit, indeed, which I have seldom failed to observo lnrk-

*- Mr. Westxvood, FMLS„ having more fully described this curious iusect in a letter dated Novem-
ber aoth, 1838, with which he kindly favoured me, I will add the following interesting account from
it: “The insects you have sent me are as anomalous as the production they inhabit. From their
small size, soft texture, six long legs, and green colour, they have much the appearance of small
wingless Aphidcs; but this is only in appearance. On examining them under a lens, they are seen
to be 153-j0inted, of an elongated ova] form, clothed at the sides, and especially at the extremity of
the body, with very long setae, which are also found sparingly upon the legs. The latter organs are
not those of a perfeetly organized imago, for they resemble those of the immature C'oecidae, or rather
the legs of the larvae. of the Ilemerohii, &o The antenna} are nearly half the length of the body,
very slender, arising from an inerassated basa] joint, and apparently very indistinctly articulated. 'I‘hss
mouth consists only of four exeeedingly fine setae, as long as the antennee, between which they are
constantly porreeted, arisiug in pairs at a short distance apart. The underside of the body, or at least
some of the terminal segments are furnished with elongated, flattened, membraneus appendages;
which, from analogy with some of the aquatic Neuropterous and Trichopterous larvae, are evidently
salse gius, and employed in respiration. From the characters, and with the materials Ι now possess,
it is impossible to decide upon the real nature of these little animals: neither is it possible to decide
whether they are 111 the larva or imago state. There are some imagines amongst the Aphidoe, Coccidae,
and some other groups‚ which never gain wings, but always retain their larvalike form: and in the
Coccidae we have a mouth composed of four elongated setae, as I have discovered; but then these
