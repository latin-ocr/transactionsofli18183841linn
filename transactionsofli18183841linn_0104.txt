82 Mr. GRIFFITH οη the Development of

marked down several points for particular study at Mergui during the rainy
season; but it is now very probable that a considerable time will elapse before
1 can recur to this very interesting subject. A particular series of observa—
tions is required as to the precise mode in which the radiole, or seininal
sucker as it may be called, of the young parasite, as well as those of the
latei-al shoots‚ reach the sui-face of the wood. Observations on those species
of Viscum which have a plurality of embryos, and on the exact mode of
adhesion of this genus to the stock, will likewise afford many interesting par—
ticulars.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

Fig. l. Longitudinal section osan ovarium of Lai-anthus Sem-mla.

α. Parietes of the calyx. b. Bases of two petals remaining. ιι
Ovariuin. d. Its upper portion, where it is continuous with th<¹
tissne of the style. QCentral, transverse, opake, linear spot, the sitc
of the future excavation.

Fig.:2. a. Parietes of the calyx. h. Commencement of the viscous tissue.
c. Ovariuin. d. Its upper portion, which is now traversed by a
brown line passing through the centre of the style3 the adjacent
tissue being sphacelated. e. Extension of the sphacelated line trans-
versely. The excavation has just cornmenced.

ln one instance the tissue of the sucker was prolonged downwards between the wood and bark of the
stock. The centre of this prolongation was occupied by a ligneous fasciolo: '

To show the fact of a non-continuity of tissue, the section must always be carried through the
centre of each sucker, and the branch to which it is applied. As these suckers have not a linear but
a discoid attachment, a lateral section will give the appearance osan intermixture of fibres.

Fig. 2, 3 ἃ 4. are taken from the same species. Ι have verified the above in one species belonging
to the section scurrula, from which the sketches were taken, and in one of thc section Sympleyantlms.

ΤΑΒ. VIII. fig. 5 a& G. represents a young plant of a species of LoranUcus, attached by a broad base
to an elevation of corresponding breadth of the branch, which, however, it overlaps: see fig. 7. Thev
elevation visible in the braneh is produced by the passage of the roots of the parasite under the bark.

They expanti so as to form what the French term a lnite'd'oie. Here, again, the roots do not penetrate
beyond the original attachment.
