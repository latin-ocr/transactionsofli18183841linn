influence of the air, the fewer are the granules they contain. The size of the
cavity between the sporular and thecal membranes varies in different species,
and in the same species at different periods of its growth, whilst in some, as
Ortltotriclmm dialtltmmm, these membranes are in contaet¹ ; in others, of which
Fumo-ia liqisgrtmzetrisa and Burri-amia [nummu-»nis are the most marked exarn-
ples, they are widely distant, this distance, however, is constautly diminish-
ing by the growth of the columella and the gradual development of the spo-
rules.

I shall venture to offer a conjecture as to the use of the stomata in mosses,:
it is but this moment formed, therefore you cannot expect it to be very maturcd.
Iu my paper published in the last volume of the Linnean Transacffions& I
have endeavoured to prove that the sporules are, in point of fact, pollen, dif-
fering from ordinary pollen merely in the. greater firinness of its coats, a pro-
vision rendered necessary by its immediate exposure to the soil without the
intervention of a peculial· apparatus (the ovulum) to prepare it for germination.
Now my conjecture is, that the sternata, by admitting the aceess of the air, do,
if not fully cause, at least promote, the hardening of the coats of the sporules.
There are some facts which favour this conjecture: the Phascums, with but
one exception, have stomata, and as the operculum is persistent, it would
appear that there is no other way by which the aetion of the atmosphere on
the sporules can take plaee3 again, they are not found on the Polytrichums
nor on Ifzsmetmffomum nzicro.st‹›mmn, which are so construeted, the first with
a tympanum and closely approximating teeth3 the last, in the first instance,
with a perfect tympanum, which finally becomes perforated with a minute
hole3 that after the fall of the operculum, in either instance, the dispersion of
the spor-illes is prevented until the hardening process has taken place. Opposed
to these last are the Gymnostomums, in which the sporules would be almost
instantly dispersed after the fall of the operculum, and therefore the harden-
ing must be effeeted before that occurs; and as far as I have yet seen, stomata
exist 011 all the species. The exception in the Phaseums, and some few others
amongst the peristomed mosses, are at present a stumbling-block; but it is
not impossible that future observations may discover either a peculiarity in
the hygrometric nature of the peristome, or that the operculum after its de-
