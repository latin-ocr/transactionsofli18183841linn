178 Prrgf. Dou's l)e.s*et·1'ptions qs two new Genera qftlte

Since the preceding observations were in type, I have been favoured by my
friend Mr.S1nith‚ of the Royal Botanie Gardens at Kew, with a specimen of
szninglmmla simensis, bearing several male catkins, and a full-grown cone.
A careful examination of this remarkable plant has satisfied me that its proper
place in a systematic arrangement is among the Cupressffnew, next to „latratas-i.»
and (¹121fflt‹›meria‚ to both of whom it is related in a nearly equal degree. In the
form, structure, insertion, direcffion, and number of its ovula it agrees entirely
with the former genus, from which it is principally distinguished by its elon-
gatcd aggregate male spikesq and by the addition of a third polliniferons theca.
The placentary region is crowned with a thin, nar1·0w‚ minutely toothed bordei·⁷
clearly of the sanie nature with the remarkable toothed organ, which I have
described as the pericarpium iu C'Jysplonzeria, and which, singular as it is, can
no longer bc regarded in any other light than as an excessive development of
thc plaeentary region, and what I have described as a bracte is really the apex
of the pericarpial leaf. The enlarged placentary region, and the ercet ovula,
are characters ainply sufficient to separate C'tysptomeria from Cumlinglmmla,
iu which the polliniferous thecae are fewer, and altogether free. The striking
reseliiblanec, both in form and structure, of the anthei-iserous scales to those of
the female spike, and also to the bractes and leaves, clearly show that they arc
all modifications ot' one and the same organ. In all the three genera above-
nwntioned the antheriferous thecae bear an evident relation to the number of
the ovula, the latter apparently originating in all cases from the upper, and
the former from the inferior surfaee ot' the modilied leaf. The direction of the
«mula, which iu all cases are at1·opous‚is evidently a character of no more than

generic value in this family.
