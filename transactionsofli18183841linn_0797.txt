“ The Stoi-my Petrel is feathered just to the ta1·saljoint; but in
lVilson's Petrel the feathers only approach within 4 lines of it.. In the
former the tarsus is in length l line short of an inch, in the latter
l inch 4 lines, and equally slender with the foriner3 and the hindei·
toe is so minute, that it might escape any but attentive examination.
In the bill the markings are more strongly defined, with the ter-
minal hook longer and sharper. The prominence of the forehead is
less than in the more common species. Colour of the head l)lack‚
with a tint of hoary, lighter on the throat. The back, belly, wings
and tail ferrugineus, lighter on the wing-coverts; the runip white,
and a little of the same at the vent. Tarsi and feet blaek, with a
longitudinal stripe of sulphur-yessow, niore golden at the hordeis, on
the web between each toe.

‘⁶ This species, being of a stouter configuration than the common
Petrel, is probably better able than it to escape the violence of a
storm3 the reason, perhaps, why it does not inore frequently coine
near our coasts. But something also may be ascribed to the manner
of its flight; that of the Storiuy Petrel resembling the hovering nio-
tion ofa But, and thus going before the violence ofa gale, rather
than couuteraeting its influence. As the minuter actions of these
birds are so little known, it may be interesting to add, that in exa-
mining the stomach of a Stoi-my Petrei, about the length of hals
an inch of a common tallow candle was found, of a size so dispro-
portioned to the bill and gullet of the bird, that it seems wonderful
how it could have been able to swallow it. lt. is renim-hed, that when
