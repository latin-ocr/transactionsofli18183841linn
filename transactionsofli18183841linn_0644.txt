the space between the true pericarpium and the cohering periauthium consists
of a mass of long, transverse cells; excepting that upon the three placentae.v
as well as 011 two longitudinal lines in the middle of each intervening space,
the membranes approach each other with scarcely any cellular tissne between
them, and upon these lines the fruit easily separates (from its being necessarily
weaker at those points as the eapsule dries and ripens) into three broad and
three narrow valves, without exhibiting any traee of those longitudinal nerves
which usually form a distinet margin to capsular valves. In IJe'etgsostega and
the related genera there exists but a small quantity of cellular tissue between
the true ovarium and adnate periauthium, and hence the capsule is almost
membmnaceous when ripe; but in a similar position to that exhibited in
Orchitleoe, is to be seen only a single line where the two membranes closely
approximate, and which in like manner sometimes become ruptured from a
similar cause, when the capsule ripens, and hence the separation into three
imperfect valves is effected not by any regular fissure, but by an irregular
laceration of the adhering membranes at those points where they are not
strengthened by intervening tissue. On comparing also the seeds of Plen-
rntlmllis pectinata with those of Dictyostega m-ohanclzmidos, there appears
scarcely any differenee between them either in shape οι· structure, both pos-
sessing a diaphanous reticulated testa many times larger than the nucleus:
in Plemvtlmllis, however, the reticulations are much smaller and more
regular, and the cells constituting the arcolae are marked with spiral fibres
bearing some resemblance to the spiral cells occur-ring in the leaves of that
genus: on the other hand, the areolae of the seeds of Dietyostega are much
larger, longer, more transparent, and destitute of fibres. ln regard to the
included nucleus, the two genera offer a striking analogy, as it is in both
inverted‚ and suspended by an elongated base from the attenuated apex of
the rostelliform seed, and in both presents its nipple-like apex towards the
hilum.

Besides the points of resemblance already mentioned, these plants present
in other respects a striking approximation to Orclzidea‘, especially to the
section of Plelo-otlzalleoe, which often possess a simple erect stem with im—
perfectly developed leaves, and are not uilfrequently destitute of the pseudo-
bulbs, so characteristic of the tribe: they often exhibit also a regular six-
