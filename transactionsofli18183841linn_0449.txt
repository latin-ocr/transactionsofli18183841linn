with some Remarks οη the Nature (gf the Spongiae Marinae. 373

their fixed* localities in the cells or pores of the Sponge, I deposited them in
a china dish nearly filled with water, which I renewed twice a day. Ι was
most attentive in examining not only with my naked eye, but also with a
powerful lens, whether these bodies possessed any spontaneous motions, but
could not discover the least appearance of any3 on the contrary, the instant
they were put into the water they sunk to the bottom of the dish; there
remaining 1110110111055, 111051 of them connnenced to germinate, and became
permanently fixed. Several of these seedlike bodies being of different sizes,
I found that some began to grow sooner than others, probably by reason of
their being in a more mature state. The manner of germination, according
1ο my observation, is this: when the seedlike body has lain a sufficient time
in the water, a very small quantity of a soft opake substance appears sponta-
neously protruding froin its apex or orifice at its top; it is of a pure white
0010111, and soon glues the secdlike body to the dish; this substance gradu-
ally increases, and sometimes entirely enveloping the parent body, continues
spreading over whatever object it has attached itself to. At first there are no
distinct traces of the Sponge itself‚ but only a white thick gelatinous matter,
like a piece of wet cotton-wool, is all that is to he seen: this, however, when
allowed to dry, will exhibit the thin membrane of the Sponge, and the oscules
and cells or pores formed by the interlacing and crossing of the young fibres
with the sharp and prominent spicula. As a few of these bodies, after several
days, did not germinate, Ι squeezed them sufficiently hard so as to break their
envelopes or 5110115, and pressed 0111 11 little of the inner opake substance,
which then very readily grew and enlarged.

Having thus clearly proved that this Spongilla is capable of being repro-
duced or grown both from its fixed seedlike, and from its 1000111011γο germ-
like, bodies†‚ it therefore is to be further inquired concerning the real nature

of them.

* M. De Lamarck is wrong where he has defined these bodies as “granula plurima gelatinosa non
affixa in cellulis.'' (An. sans Vert. tom. ii. p. 98. edit. 1816.) But M. Dutrochct thus correctly de-
scribes the like bodies in the Spouyilla lacustris: “corps oviformes de couleur jaune, et qui adheraient
au tissu fibreux.” (p. 206.) Again‚ at p. 211, he says, “ les fibres les plus grosses auxquclles etaient.
fixes d'innombrables corps oviformes.’' See Annal. des Sci. Nat. tom. xv.

† It perhaps seems inconsistent to say that the Sponge may be reproduced from both these bodies.
But I will thus explain it: the fixed seedlike body contains within it a somewhat transparent jellv
