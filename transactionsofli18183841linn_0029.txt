Mr. W oons on tlte Genera, ofEampean Grasses. 15

usually embraces the base of the i11ne1·; but in Phalaris and Achnmlonton. by
the help of the position and direction of the lateral nerve, they have the
appearance of bein-g almost valvular. The only genera in which the outer
glunic is the largest are, Jlilinm, Aclzrmtlzeram, Gastritlium and Calama-
grostis and Degseua‘ia. The substance of the glmncs is sometimes of use
in determining genera3 but on this head there seems to be a great dif-
ference in the terminology of different authors, and perhaps few authors
are always perfectly consistent with themselves, expressing the same eha-
raeter by different words in different places, and even different characters
apparently by the same word. Thus the glumes of Milium are menda-amum
according to Kunth and Gaudin‚ herbaceum, if we consult Ilooker. The
paleae of the same plant are subcoriaceous in Kunth. cartilaginous in Gaudin.
Kunth applies alike the term membranaceoas to the paleze of Alopecwws and
of Phalaris, though the consistence is certainly very different. I find these
parts of Grasses described by different authors as carnosa», cartilaginem, co-
riaceoe, chartacea), papyraceoe, lterbacew, membranta-ew² scat-iam, llssalinw.
tenerrime membranacece, and with different compounds of these ternis. l
distinguish

Fam: Very thiu and transparent. The paleae of most speeies of i-Indropo-
gon and Sorglzwn may bc taken as examples of this degree of solidity. The
palea also of Knappia, and the inner palca of the neutral floret of Oplixnzenas,
and the inner palea of some species of Agrostis and of other (ii-asses.

SCARIOSE. Transparent, like the preceding, bnt firmer: it exists in the
paleae of Phleum‚ and of many other Grasses, and in the glumes of Puhspagon
and Stipa.

MEMBRANOUS. Still firmer: translucent but not transparent‚ and often
coloured (but not green). ch find it iu the glumes of Agra-stis aud Arunda.
111 the palcae of Poa nemoralis and Glycerio aquatica.

We may use the compound term BIEMBRANo-SCARIOSE f01· an interme-
diate state, as 111 the glumes of Desclmmpsia ‹vespam-a and of Amana pubes-
cens.

HERBACEOUS. Green, and nearly of the texture of a leaf, as in the barren
floret of the Paniceaee. This perhaps differs more in colom· than iu substance

from membranous.
