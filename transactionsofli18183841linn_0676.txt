576 Rev. M. J. BERKELEY on a Gall gatlzercd in Culta

So palpable arc some analogies between various productions of Insects
and Fungj„ that many eggs, galls, διο. have been described by authors as
true Fungi. The eggs of an Homo-obius, for instance, are Corda's (ia-ate-
rmngsces candidus. lepoaylon ‹rs-trasenna Bull. (Splewria osb-acea, Sow.) is
the nidus of an insect, as Ι have myself ascertained, though Ι have not as
yet been able to learn of what order. Atrartobolus ubiquitarius, Tode, is
the egg of some Avarus, of the genus Rapliignatlms, probably, or some
allied genus. It is most remarkable, however, that Fries has lately found
a real Fungus whose characters agree exactly with those laid down from
the insect's egg. Epis-ltysium argenteum, Tode, is, according to the great
Swedish mycologist, certainly entomogenous. The same may be said of some
Ascoltlmroe.

The cggs of Crioceris Asparagi are so exactly like Acrospermum com-
pressum, that it is diffie-ult to distinguish them without analysis. In exa-
mining moulds the mycologist is often puzzled by the apparent presence of
spor-augia, which on more close inspection turn out to be the eggs of some
minute Acco-i.

Again, various galls assume the form of Fungi, so that specimens are often
transmitted as such hy young botanists. Sclemtizmzfimeiculatum, Schumacher,
Fl. Dan. tab. 1492, is a common gall on oak-leaves3 c'alocera Lauri, Broter0,
a clavariaeform produc-tion, is, I understand, caused by an insect. But none
perhaps is more remarkable than the subject of the present memoir‚ which at
once so closely resembles a Fungas, and differs, in its erumpent habit and
operculum, so much from other galls, that (on a cursory inspection indeed) it
was regarded as an epiphytous Fungus by some of our first botanists‚ and was
not recognised as the work of an insect even by the great entomologist who
gathered it in Cuba, where it appears to be abundant.

On the occasion of making me a most kind offer of collecting Fungi for my
Herbarum), in Australia, Mr. MacLeay was so good as to transmit to me for
examination a leaf studded with the productioris in question.

plants. It appears to have escaped observation that Kunze first pointed out the spiral structure of the
flocci in Trichiaceoe. See Kz. Ι. c. vol. ii. p. 94. Klotzsch also made the same discovery in examining
the Fungi of Sir W. J. Hooker‘s Herbarium in the year 1831.
