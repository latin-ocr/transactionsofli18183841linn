1 denominate the superior spinners; that furthest removed from the anus, the
inferior spinners3 and the mannnulze placed between these extremes, the in-
termediate spi1me1·s; distinguishing them, when there are two pairs, by pre-
fixing the ternis superior and inferior. Exceedingly fine moveable papillae or
spinning tubes, for the most part dilated at the base, occur at the extremity
of thc mammulae, or are (lisposed along the inferior sui-face of their terminal
joint3 whence issues the viscous secretion of which the silken lines produced
by spiders are formed, The minute apertures without projecting margins,
described by Lyonnet, Leeuwenhoek, T1·cvi1·a1u1s,and other eminent anatomists
and microscopic observers as likewise emitting lines ἢ Ι have failed to detect
on the closest inspectioli, assisted by optical instruments possessing high mag-
nifying powers ; l am under the necessity, therefore, of withholding my assent
from an opinion which, in consequence of the celebrity of its advocates, is
very generally adopted. It is· true that I can disccrn small pores with which
the mammulae are abundantly supplied 3 but as they arc¹ distributed over their
entire sui-sace, and occupy the intervals between their bases, from which no
lines are. ever seen to proceed3 mol-eover, as Ι have never, under any circum-
stances, pereeived the viscous matter of which the lines are composed issuing
from these pores, but uniformly from the papillae or spinning-tubes, Ι must
regard the latter as solely instrumenta! in the omission of the silken filaments
transmittcd from the mammulse3 indeed, interspersed among the papillae, as
the poi-es constantly are, they would prove a source of the utmost inconveni-
encc were they endowed with the property which seems to have been ascribed
to them.

Attempts have been frequently made to ascertain the number of papillae
connected with the spinning= mammulae of spiders ; but ln every instance with
which Ι ain acquainted they appear to be estimated much too l1ighly; in
point of fact, they vary greatly in number in different specics, and also differ
eonsiderably in sizo, not only in individuals of the same species, but often
even 011 the same mammulae.

Among British spiders, the largcr species of Epeirw have the mammulae
most amply provided with papillce3 it is probable, however, that the total
number does not greatly exceed a thousand even in adult females of Epeira
