Mr. BLACKWALL'S Descriptions of ncw Species qs Spiders. 607

employed to curl certain lines proceeding from the sphmers, observed to con-
stitute the most remarkable character in the wcb of every spider compriscd in
this family, those supplied by the inferior pair being wrought into a delicate
inflected band, which chiefly imparts to the snare its most important property,
namely, that ofadhesion*.

Crevices in rocks and walls, and the foliage of trees and shrnbs‚ are the
favourite haunts of the Cing'flom'dw, which, by their general organization and
habits, should innnediately follow the Drassicloe in the systematic arrange-

ment of the Araneidea.
Gen. CINIFLO.

This is the only spider at present ascertained to belong to the genus Cim· (Γ,
though, from what is stated by M. lValckenaer relative to the appearance of
the web of Clubiona ferar, Faune Francaise, Araneides, p. 152, it scarcely
admits of a doubt that this species also is provided with eight spinners and
with calamistra3 to assign it a place, however, among the Cinfflonidoe before
this point has been determined by observation would be prematur-e.

I may remark, that the relative length of the legs is different in the sexes of
Ciniflo atrav, the second pair being rather longer than the fourth in the male.

* For a description of the calamistrum and of the manner in which it is employed by the Ciniflonidff
in the fabrication of their webs, and for aa account of the discovery of the fourth pair of spinners in
spiders belonging to this family, see the Transactions of the Linneau Society, vol. xvi. p. 473, et seq..

and vol. xviii. p. 223.
