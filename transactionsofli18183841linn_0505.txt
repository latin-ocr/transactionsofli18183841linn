Prcf. LINDLEY on the Anatomgs oftlze Roots (f Ophrydeae. 427

It then appeared that the nodules, apparently so homogeneous, are composed
of extremely minute transparent cells, filled, Ι presume, with a secretion of
the same refractivc power as themselves, and adhering to each other so firmly,
that in their fresh state no spaces could be detected among them. In their
charred condition, however, the double walls of the cells, intercellular spaces,
and even here and there the cytoblasts, became so distinetly visible, that the
accompanying figure 3. was readily made with a camera lucida adapted to an
achroniatic microscope magnifying 480 diameters.

These statements are, Ι, should think, sufficient to show that the roots of
Oplwysdew are not compbsed, to any great extent, of starch, but that their
peculiar properties are owing to the presence of a large quantity of a gummy
secretion, which for the present may be called Bassorine, collected in cellular
horny nodules.

It remains for me to explain in what way the error has probably arisen of
those who, like Guibourt and Payen, describe Salep as chiefly composed of
starch. It is well known that Salep is prepared by boiling the roots of ΟΜΝ-3]-
deoe, and then drying them. The effect of boiling is to dissolve what starch
exists in the parenehyma surrounding the nodules of Bassorine3 the dissolved
starch will flow over the sides of the cells and the sui-face of the nodules,
from which when dried it becomes undistinguishable; and consequently when
iodine is applied to Salep, the whole mass will appear to have become iodide
of starch. Attention having been called to the facts above mentioned, there
remains no difficulty in seeing that the general diffusion of blue is apparent
only. In reality, if, after iodine is applied to Salep and the blue colour is pro-
duced, the nodules are removed, which is not difficult, they are found to re-
tain their original vitreous lustre, and to have been coloured apparently only
hythe reflection, through their semitransparent sides, of the blue iodide of
stareh by which they are surrounded. That this explanation is true, may be
proved experimentally, by examining the roots of Orcln's maculata, both fresh
and subsequently to their being made into Salep.
