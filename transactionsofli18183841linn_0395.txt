the snout‚ and gradually inereasing to the height of five lines, is thus continued
into the candal membraneus expansion. This fin is supported by niunerous
sofr, clastic‚ transparent rays articulated to the extremities of the superior and
inferior peripheral spines of the candal vertebrae z the under part of the candal
fin commences about one ineh behind the vent.

The entire body is covered with cycloid scales ὴὲ, which are relatively lai-ger,
but have the same general structure and disposition as in the Lepidasiren
pamrdooea. They present a subeircular form, with a diameter of about three
lines3 their posterior margin adheres to the strong euticle, with whieh they
are removed as in other fishes: the anterior margin lies freer in a correspond-
iug groove of the Chorion. then viewed with a low magnifying power they
present a series of canals, radiating somewhat irregularly from a eentre near
the posterior eilge of the scales, and maintaining a unit'orm diameter. These
canals are united together by cross canals, whieh do not form regular eou-
eentrie lines. The meshes formed by this reticulation are small and of a sub-
quadrate form at the anterior part of the scale, but are more elongated in the
middle of the scale: they are, again, smaller and shorter at the circumference.
With a magnifying power of 150 linear diameters the interspaees of the larger
canals are seen to be occupied by a finer network of apparent tubes, and
from an angle of each of these spaces a short obtuse proeess, projecting
slightly baekwards, is developed on the external surfaee of the seale: the
inter-nal surface is· quite smooth. There are three or four faint eoneentrie
lines of growth at the eircumferenee of the scale, but this body is evidently
one continuous organized whole. The subeuticular tissue of thc scale is a
kind of dense elastic cartilage, not yielding any gas-bubbles on the application
of aeid. The scales are continued upon the base of the candal natatory sold
of integumenn

The disposition of the mucous pores and ducts upon the head is very similar
in the two speeies of Lepidosiren, judging from the figure given by Dr. Nat>-
terer. A linear series of mueous pores eneireles each eye, and from the pos-
terior angle of this series the lateral line commences. This line extends
backwards, nearly parallel with the dorsal linc, situated a little more than
one-fourth of the vertieal diameter of the body from that line, until it nearly
