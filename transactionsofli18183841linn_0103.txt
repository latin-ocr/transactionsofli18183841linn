The infiuence these parasites possess over the stock is according to their
recipi-ocal size: L. scurrula, generally attached to ,Helas-loma malabathrica,
or other shrubs, frequently destroys them to a considerable extent. Others,
again, Which arc minute in comparison with the stock, such, for instance, as
those that grow upon trees, produce no appreciable deleterious effect.

The foregoing notes apply chiefly to the development of the ovula. I had

the generality of Lorantlzaceae‚ with this species it is far different, the primary and secondary attach-
ments taking place by suckers which appear to reach the older formed wood. From the first attach-
ment roots are sent off npwards and downwards. These run to a considerable length, and adherc
very firmly by means of suckers, which likewise are imbedded in the substance of the stem.

In this specimen the branches are confined to the stem originating from the primary attachment.
The roots, however, have the power of sending off shoots. The suckers produce a most pernicious
effect on the branches along which the roots take their course, and from their large size soon produce
atrophy.

These roots have the same anatomy as the branches, the medullary rays being less distinct and the
medulla almost obliterated; it does exist, however, in a rudimentary state.

The suckers are composed of cellular tissue, and form part of the cortical system, with which they
are continuous. The cells are long and arranged at right angles with the woody system. No cuticle
covers the adhering surface of the sucker.

The pith is excentriC, and, as might be expected, nearest the circumferenee on the side of the adhe-
sion. The more vigorous and older of these suckers pierce the albumen to a greater or less distance;
but no identification of substance appears to take place, the fibres ot* the suckcrs being at right angles
with those of the alburnum. In all probability they have not the power of piercing into the substance
of the wood, their greater depth in the older and largcr branches being owing to the deposit of new
ligneous matter. At the same time a corresponding increase takes place in the eucher, which becomes
hard towards its base. The upper bourrelet surrounding the suckers is always the larger.

TAB. IX. fig. 1. represents a sketch taken from a sucker about three inches below the axis; irregu-
lar fascicles of woody matter have passed off from the wood into the sucker, into which they penetrate
deeply. They all appear to terminate at a short distance from the adhering surface of the sucker.
which is entirely cellular, and much less coloured than the rest; it is still large. The terminations of
the woody fascicles are generally clavate. So great is this tendency to throw out suckers that when
two roots encounter each other, as they frequently do, they throw out suckers and form mutual adhe-
sions. In this case there is actual identification of structure, woody fibrous bundles passing off
from both and becoming identified with the wood. See TAB. IX. fig. 4. It does not take place through-
out the whole length of the sucker‚ but is chiefly confined to its upper position.

Tan. lx. fig. 2. represents the original attachment on the apex of a branch. There is 1n this no
union between the woody systems‚ although the irregular woody bundles have at (ι, nearly reached
the pith. Still the edges of the wood of the stock are entire. The irregularities of this, observable
at b, c, depend probably upon an attempt at formation of wood on this side. The depth at which the
sucker has apparently pierced is owing in reality to its original attachment, which must have taken
place when the stem of the stock was very thiu: consequently the pith would be near the surfaee.
