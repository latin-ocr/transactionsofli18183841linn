thi Per- Dou’s Descriptions of two new Genera oftlte

consist of a single vertieil in the former, and two verticils in the latter, species:
or they are disposed in threes, as in C. l'entenatii, and the periearpia then
consist of two verticils or six pieces. In Pinus and other genera, the verti-
cillate arrangement is completely rc-established at the nodi, or points where
thc elongation of the internodes ceasesg as is seen by the buds or branches,
although the leaves themselves, from whose axils they procecd, are often
reduced to the condition of mere scales; and we may also remark, that the.
abortire branc-hes of the Strobus tribe present a series of verticils of leaves,
like the young scedling with its cotyledons. These facts, in my opinion, tend
to overthrow the beautiful theory of the spiral development of the foliaeeous
orginis, which has amused and puzzled the botanical world for some years past.

Ι regret that in the only mature seed of ‚Issa-utaris, which Ι had an oppor-
tunity of examffling, the embryo had been destroyed by some insect; but, from
the leaves in ,1, ςιιμνικνκοίιίμκ being in pairs, Ι conclude that the cotyledons are
two, and that the fifth leaf of the spire in A.selagi›10i1le.s is the first of the
succeeding third pair.

As in many genera of (ἰιηζίὶυτυ the periearpia are seen to differ but little,
either in form or arrangement, from the ordinary leaves of the plant, we
should expect to find a corresponding simplicity in the structure of the male
organs. The scales, as the)v are usually termed, of the male spike Ι consider
to bc the antherw, although they usually present a foliaceous character, and
the thecae as parts of a simple anther„ a portion only of the subcutaneous cel-
lular tissue being apparently converted into pollen. In the greater part of
the genera of this family, such, for example, as (⁷'ulutatu-imese and flaminem,
where the thecze are arranged in a single series and situated at the external
base of the scale, it would seem to be a portion of the under surface of
the moditied leaf that becomes transformed into pollen3 and this is also the
case in (¹1111mi21gl1111211'11. On the other hand, in Dammarn and Amnem-ia,
where the thecze are numerous and disposed in a double series, a portion of
both surt'uees of the leaf may be supposed to be converted into pollen. On
examiuing the scales or anthers at au early period, the masses of pollen will
be found to present the appearance of small elevatious oceupying the lower
base of the scale. At this period the raised portions ot' the cutiele present
