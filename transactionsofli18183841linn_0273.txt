quadrata, whose weight is about twenty grains9 and in many other speeies it
is mueh smaller. Each of the six mammulae, in every living Epeira whose
spinning apparatus Ι have attentivcly iuspected, has presented one or more
papillae decidedly larger than the rest, which uniforlnly oceupy the same re-
lative situations iu individuals identieal in spceies3 but I have not yet been
able to satiessfy mysclf what especial purposes they subserve.

wishing to determine by experiment the strength of a line by which a female
Epeira diadema, weighing ten grains, had suspended itself from a twig‚ I at-
tached to its extremity a small square pieee. of muslin with the corncrs nearly
drawn together, so as to foi-111 a minute sack, into which Ι caret'ully introduced
sixty-one grains in suecession, being rather inore than six times the weight of
the spider, before it broke; but on the addition of half a grain more it gave
way.

In several speeies belonging to the genus Tegenaria of lValekenaer, in
Tegenmv’a domestica and Tegeum-ia virilis, for example, the total number of
papillae does not amount to four hundred ; iu Tastris· agilis, Blaekw.‚ Lycosa
sacrata, and Clubimm corta-alis, it is below three hundred; in Ilitlclsenaera*
acuminata, Blackw„ and Segestria scmwalnta, it scarcely execeds one hundred ;
and in many of the smaller spidcrs it is still further reduced.

A differcuee in the number and size of the papillae connected with the seve-
ral paiis of mammulae in the sanie speeies, and with similar pairs in different

species, is also very apparent. In the spiders constituting the genera Epcira,
Tetragnatlla, Lt'ngspltia> 'Htw-idion, ›S'‹¹gestria, and many others, they are gene-

rally much more numerous and minute on the inferior spinners than on the
superior and intermediate ones: the last are the most sparingly supplied with
them, and in the ease of §egesti-ia senor-alata each has only three large papillae
at its extremity. An arrangement nearly the reverse of this takes place in
some of the Dvassi, and may be advantageously seen in Drassm· aler. This
species has thc intermediate spinuers abundantly furnished with papfflze, those
on the inferior spinncrs being very few in number and chiefly of large dimen-
simis, emitting the viseous seeretion copiously. For the purpose of deter-
miuing how many papillae are connected with the short termina! joint of each
