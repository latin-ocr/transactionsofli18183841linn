placentae, a relation most usual in cases of compound unilocular ovaria where
the number of stigmata and placentae is equal; and that such is really its
relation appears to him to be proved by tracing to their origin their vascular
cords, which are found to coalesce with those of the three outer foliola of the
perianthium. This view of the composition of the ovarium in Orclzideoe, he
observes, is confirmed by finding that it agrees with the ordinary arrangement
of Monocotyledonous plants, viz, the opposition of the double parietal pla-v
centa? to the three inner divisions of thc perianthium, while in Apus-{asia the
three placentae of the trilocular ovarium are opposite to the three outer divi-
sions. The same agreement, he further observes, is found in δοίΐαηιῐηθω, both
iu the placentae of the trilocular orarium, which in this family is its ordinary
structure, and in the uniloeular, which is the exception. My observations
upon the structure of Βιινηιαηηι’(ισθα1 afford to that order a different arrange-
ment as regards the position of stigmata. Dr. Von Martius, in illustratiug
the genus Burmmmia, has given a figure of the pistillum of Β. bicolor, in
which the stigmata are placed opposite to the wings, and therefore alternate
with the inncr scgments of the perianthium ς but this probably may have been
an error of the draughtsman, since no such position is alluded to in the text.
Ι have in several instances opencd with the utmost care thc flowers of Bm·-
mamn'n, and have found the stigmata manifestly placed as I have constantly
observed them in Di(·(1s‹)-s·t‹2g‘‹1 and the allicd genera with unilocnlar capsules,
viZ. opposite to the stamens, and to the inner segments of the perianthium, with
which the placentae also correspond, all being alternate with the outer seg-
ments: in Burmanni«, however, owing to the complete inflection of the car-
pellary leaves to form the trilocular ovarium, the placentae thus extended
to the axis will be seen directed towards the middle of the cells, and opposite
to the. outer segments of the perianffiium, at the same time that all other parts
remain as before mentioned, in a similar position to that existing in Dis-
(isostega.

This deviation from the usual order of relation may probably be accounted
for by the very ingenious views of Mr. Brown relative to the original compo-
sition of stigma, founded on the supposition that each simple pistillum or
carpel has necessarily two stigmata, which are to be regarded not as terminal,
but lateral, in the same manner that the placentae of each carpellary leaf are
