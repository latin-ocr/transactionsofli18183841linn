XXVII. observatiam· οη the Cause of Ergot. By Mr. JOHN Saum, Alma

Read November 6, 1838.

THE substance called Ergot being a production which has given rise to a
diversity of opinions, in regard to its nature and origin, and the more than
usual quantity this season on several species of Elymus and other grasses in
the Royal Botanic Gai-(len at Kew having attracted my attention, Ι was in-
duced to examine it, and Ι beg to lay the result of my observations before the
Linnean Society.

Ergot is well known to be a black fungoid-looking body, seated within the
floret, and protruding beyond the glumes (in the manner of a spur) of many
species of grasses, especially the Rye. DeCandolle considers it as a fungus, and
refers it to the genus Sclerotium. Fries also includes it among fungi, giving
it the name of Spermoedia Clavus, with the following generic character :—
“ Variable, rounded, entophytal‚ rootless; of a fleshy, mealy, homogenous tex-
ture, with a rind concrete, scaly, or somewhat pruinose. Proper fructification
none.” He concludes, however, by stating, that “it is only a morbid con-
dition of the grain of corn, not propagated by seeds, but generated by a par-
ticular combination of external influences ;” and observes that some consider
Ergot to be caused by the puncture of insects. Ι had paid some attention to
the subject for several years past, and from the circumstance of observing a
peculial· species of fly settling on the ergot-bearing spikes, I was led to sup-
pose that they were in some way instrumental in producing it ; but what more
particularly attracted my attention this autumn was, early one morning ob-
serving large drops of a brown-coloured liquid hanging from the spikes of an
Elymus, which contained a number of full-grown ergots; and towards the
apex of the spike, where the ergots were younger, Ι also observed nearly sirni-
lar but more transparent drops.

This liquid in either state was found to be viscid, and of a sweet taste; and
