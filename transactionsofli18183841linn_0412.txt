Amphiuma and Menopoma, to 111011· termination at the opposite side of the vas-
cular circle. The branches which afterwards unite to form the single pulmo-
nary artery ou each side are given off from near the termination of the se-
cond 111111 third pairs of the primitive aortic trunk3 which thus combine the
fonctions of both systemie 111111 pulmonary 111-101105.

Τ110 1111111011110 of the Lepidosirmz resemble 111 form those of the Siren, con-
sisting of separate elongated filaments, attached only by one extremity to the
111-1100111111 111·1·11; but these extremities are fixed directly to the hrauchial arch,
and not to a common pedit-le extended therefrom‚ 115 111 the Siren. Viewed
with 11 moderate lens the tripiunatifid structure is beautifully seen 111 011011

subeompressed 1111111101115, each of which 15 about oue line 111 length 111111 a
third of 11 11110 111 111-01111111, The second gill‡‚ which is developed, 115 before
stated, 011 the fourth branchial arch, is the largest, and consists of a double
νων of fifteen branchial filaments. The third gillg& has 11 5111111111· structure.
The fourth gill {l 0111151515, like the first, of a single 1011γ of fourteen tripinnatifid
1111111101115, which arc shorter 111111 5111111101· 1111111 those of the first.

The cartilaginous branehial arches are developed on each side 111 1110 sub-

interspaeeffl isa narrow slit three lines long, and is defended by a series of
minute denticulations 111-1110011113· from the branchial arch. Bristles are repre-
seuted as passing through the five branchia] interspaces 111 TAB. XXV. fige.
The second apertum-et* is the widest; it is five lines long, and 115 margins are
smooth: the third aperture 15 also live lines long, hut 15 narrower 1111111 1110
