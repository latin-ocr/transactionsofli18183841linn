THE genus Araclzis, hitherto consisting of the single species A.l1ypogoea‚
was universally described by the older authors as having a bipartite calyx, a
resupinate corolla‚ the pistil included within the staminal tube, and the style
of about the length of the ovarium : the flowers were. all considered as pedun-
entare, and it was observed that the upper flowers were usually sterile, whilst
in the lower ones the pedunclc became reflexcd and lengthened till it reached
the ground, which it entered, and the fruit was there matured. Such is thc
idea given in the Genera Plantarum of Linnaeus and of Jussieu3 and Laiuarck,
in his Illustrations⁷ figures various details of the reproductive organs, entirely
iu accordance with the above character. Poiteau subsequently (according to
Poiret‚ Enczscl. sileth. suppl.) 1·e111a1·ke‹l‚ that what was usually taken for the
peduncle of the flower, was in fact the tube of the calyx, within the base of
which is contained the ovat-imm and, accordingly, De Candolle and other
modern botanists describe a calyx with a long thread-like tube and a bipartite
limb, a corolla, solnewhat resupinam, inserted at the top of the tube with thc
stamina3 an ovarium borne on a short stipes within the base of the tube, with
a long thread-like style and a bearded stigmate3 the stipes of the ovariuin is
described as lengthening very rapidly after fecumlation, so as to form that rigid
peduncle which had been already observed to reach the ground before the
fruit could mature itself. The legume is well known to be oblong‚ reticulated,
indehiscent, and often somewhat torulose‚ and to contain froin one to three
seeds, with thick fleshy cotyledons and a straight radicle.

With these data great difficulties have occurred as to the immediate affini-
ties of Araclzis amongst the numerous genera composing the order of Legn-
