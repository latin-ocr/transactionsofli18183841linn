‹lo not descend to the base of the palea. It is perhaps this structure which
hats indueed Palisot de Benuvois to consider it as an awti, but it is by no
means fragile at the point of jnnetion with the palea, and something os the
sort may be traeed in some speeies of Festum.

These are united among themselves, und separated from others hy the in-
floreseence, the ¹*pienlze being niany-llowered, sessile, or very nearly ευ, on
opposite sides of a channclled and teothed rachis, eaeh tooth being the recep-
tuele of one or more spieulte, whieh is received in the ehannel above. The
exeeptionS are in Ihm—deam, :and some speeies of Elymus, where the spieulse
311'1' only one-tlowered, and in Triticum Nardus and T. unilatem‘tle, where the
spike is one-sided. Ι should not be very averse to joining these plants with
Festum, only that Ι cannot well separate them from T. Pon und T. tenellum.
'l'he latter has sometimes n hranehed ffpike, which, however„ is not one-sided,
'l'he union of these two ‹leviutions from the type os the tribe, viz. of a branehed
ratchis and one-sided inflmeseenee, hus led ine to place Triticum maritimum
(anet.) and Festus« ‹liz-art'eata, ns: Ι have already mentioned, with Festum.
