portant characters.

Such, l regret to say, are the very meagre details which alone Ι have it in
my power to give as to the generie characters of this interesting animal; Ι
have delayed the publication of my observations upon this subject for six
years, in hopes of obtaining more definite inl'ormation ; but though these hopes
have been hitherto in a great measure indulged in vain, they may perhaps be
finally realized through the medium ot' the present notice.

The only species which has come under my observation is that in the
Society's Collection, and which Major Mitchell has identified with the animal
found by him during his recent journey into the interior of Australi-a. From
the singularity of its habits, as related in the following interesting extract
from that gentleman's Journal, Ι propose to distinguish it by the specifie
name of

The length of this animal from the muzzle to the origin of the tail is ten
'mehes3 that of the tail itself nine inehes and a half3 of the head, from the
muzzle to the anterior margin of the ear, two inehes aud a quarter; of the
ear rather better than an inch ; of the anterior extren‘iities about two inches;
and of the posterior three inches and three quartem, of which the tarsus alone
measures an ineh and three quarters; the distance between the ears is about
three quarters of an inch; the distance between the eyes oue iuch3 and the
breadth of the ear three quarters of an ineh. These proportions‚ as far as
they relate to the comparative length of the anterior and posterior extremities,
are much the same as those of the Common Rabbit, or if anything‚ the
inequality is rather less considerable; on the other haud they scarcely differ
from the proportions of the same parts iu the illus longipes of Pallas, and
other species of the tetrapodal section of the Gerbilles‚ and we may therefore
reasonably infer that the paee and motions of the Οοηὶἰιινιιε constructor are in
no respect different from the movements of these animals. The length and
separation of the fingers also give it a prehensile power in the hand, which
will naturally be turned to purposes of manipulation, such as the handling of
