394 ῘΙΙν. HOGG's observatiam οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

Sponge, which constitute the mouths or entrances to the wider passages or
canals formed in that structure by the anastomosing fibres‚ and which are
precisely similar to those seen in a number of the Marine Sponges, and have
been named by Dr. Grant the faecal orifices, Ι have here called oscules (oscula),
—-a term previously used by Ellis and Solandcr and by Pallas to designate
dicun—because I consider the Spongillw, being vegetable productimis, cannot
possibly have any faeces to discharge. Although the ejectamenta, or little
pieces of soil before alluded tc», are principally the faeces not of the Spongilla,
but of certain animals parasitically nestliug within it: these have been also
mentioued by Dutrochet‚ and described by him as ⁴⁶ des fragmens de la matiere
casc'i‘forme:” they are usually of a brownish colour, and are conveyed from
the canals with the expelled current of water. On placing a living specimen
of the *S'pongilla as naturally attached to a stone, or piece of wood, Sec. in a
basin of pure water, these ejectamenta may be in a little time perecived freshly
washed out of the canals, and resting on the surface about its oscules. They
are most conspicuous on lookiug at the Sponge in the morning (having on the
previous night changed the water), when the whole specimen is generally
covered by them, and is rendered quite dirty aud discoloured. lVashing the
Sponge, by letting some fresh water run ovcr it, Ι again noticed after a few
hours more the same appearances. Audon examining the specimen, Ι dis-
covered the presence of some insect or other animal, and found that these
ejectamenta werc partly its exet-ementitious discharges, and partly bits of
broken fibres, and particles of the Sponge, which were loosened by the gnaw-
ing or burrowing of the same creature. I never observed these cjectamenta
upon any fresh specimen wherein I was unable to detect any strange animal.
Much the same sort of brownish excrement Ι have seen as emitted by the nu-
merous polypcs of Plumntella repe›zs*‚ when Ι have kept them in a glass vessel
filled with water for the purpose of studying their habits and organization.
Now, as to the fancied irritability‚ or powers of contraction and dilatation of
this species of Spongillu, numerous experiments have convinccd me that they

* The like experiment of scattering some magnesia powdcr on the surface of the water wlicrein is
contained a little colony of these Zoophytes, will demonstrate, in the same way, that eddies and cm·-
rents are in powerful action whenever any of the minute polypos have protruded themselves from their
membraneus dwellings. See ante, p. 390.
