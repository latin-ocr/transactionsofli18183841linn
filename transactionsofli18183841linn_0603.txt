without any apparent Action (gf Pallen. .’)1 l

absence of male flowers of the plant itselt' or of others related to it, and the
fact of the stigma remaining so long unehanged, and not exhibiting the sym-
ptoms usually seen in stigmas after having been acted upon by pollen, Ι ean
a1·rive‚—especially after the length of time during which 1 have watched it,—at
no other conclusion than that pollen is not essential to the pei-fecting its 50011,Υ ;
but if an external agent be necessary, and really act upon the stigma, I am
unable to say what that agent is or how it acts. I might mention a view which
I at one time entertained, namely‚ that the viscid fluid which issues from the
glands situated below the ovarium might produce some effect by exciting the
action of the pistillum; and this view received some support from finding the
young stigma often smeared with the fluid. That there is some specifie action
on the ovula Ι think there can be no doubt ; for, as in most. other plants, some
of the ovula are frequently abortive.

My object being merely to state the facts observed respecting this plant,r
without the intention of advancing any opinion on the various theories ot*
vegetable impregnation, Ι shall conclude by merely observing, that the
absence of pollen in this instance is irreconcileable with the theory that
every grain of pollen furnishes a germ, and that the ovnlum is merely a
matrix to receive and nourish it till it becomes a perfect seed.

lt is difficult to say whether this plant should be placed in any of the
numerous genera of Euplzorbiaceoe already described, the fruit scarcely dif-
fering from that of several well-known genera of the order: from its habit Ι
had considered it to bear some affinity to Sapiwn, and for that reason 111111
given it the name of *S'apium qutifolium ; 11111 011 reviewing all its characters.
Ι am now inclined to believe it to be a new genus„ to which the name ot'
Coelebogzsne may bc given.
