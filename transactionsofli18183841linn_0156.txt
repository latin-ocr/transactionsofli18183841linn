,wem upright‚ holl0w‚ angular‚ downy, particularly on the side next to the
leaves. Leares stalla—d, the npper ones sessile, hastate- or cordate-triangu-
lar, the lower angles bluntish, the nerves slightly downy. *S'tipules short,
with few simple nerves‚ bluntly pointed externally. Flowers in terminal
and axillary long-stalked panicles‚ sometimes lax and very few floweoed,
in others eondensed and inany-flowered, the pedicels not jointed. Fruit
with ovate-triangular or lanceolate faces, often slightly eoneave, longer
than broad, and transversely marked with very minute striae, trig0nous‚
the angles more or less acutely keeled, twice as long as the obtuse
calyx.

1 have not been able to (letect the usual joint in the pedicels of either this
species, F. emmgimztum, or F. rotundatum, and am inclined to think that the
flowers in all three are really sessile, the apparent pediecl being only the pro-
longcd base of the calyx. The proportion between the length and breadth of
the fruit appears to be very variable in this species3 in solue instanecs the
faces are nearly as broad as long, and in others they are so inueh lengthened

as to become truly lanceolate.

Stem upright, hollow‚ striated, downy. Leucas stall<e(l‚ triangular, the two
lower angles rounded, the ter1ninal angle elongated and acute, nerves
slightly downy. *S'tipules short, without nerves‚ blunt. Pana—les alter-
nate, terininal and axillary‚ upon long stalks‚ which are downy above:
the flowers small, with long pedica-is, which are not jointed ; the segnients
of the calyx blunt. Frait trigonous² the angles winged, with ovate faces,
which are longer than broad, sinooth and opake.
