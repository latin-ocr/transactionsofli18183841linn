sixteen in number, and in the leaf (ΓΑΒ, XXXV. fig. 24.) and root. they are
about ten or twelve3 in the latter they are arranged iu pairs (TAB. XXXV.
fig. 25.). These partitions radiate from a central column of enlarged cells
which surround a bundle of minutely dotted ‹luc-ts, that may be unrolled spi-
rally (hu. XXXV. fig. 27.), and the channels between these partitions are
frequently divided by transverse partitious or diaphragms. The cells which
form these partitions are curiously arranged (Tae. XXXV. fig. :27 &⁸28.) ; they
are flattencd on two opposite sides, and connected with each other by their
narrow sides and extremities, but only at interval:÷‚ so that there are numerous
holes formed which afford a free connnunication between all the chanucls. Iu
the partitions of the root, the interveuing holes are so large in proportion to
the breadth of the cells, that these have the appearance of a string of beads
(ΤΛΒ. XXXV. fig. ⁴28). Another peculiarity of the root is, that, in addition
to the diaphragms formed of this fissue, which are also found in the stem and
leaf, a peculim· body is frequently met with, occupying a similar position to
the diaphragms (TAB. XXXV. fig. 25.) These bodies (for they are sometimes
numerous) are each formed of one or more cylindrical cells coiled up in a
gyrate manner. They grew from the angle formed by the partition and the
cuticle‚ and are developed subsequent to the other tis-sue, for they may be
found in various stages of advancemeut iu the same root. Their nature Ι have
not been able to ascertain.

1 shall now proceed to describe the development of the Sporules. A trans-
verse section of the involucrum, when about the size of a snmll piu's head,
shows it to cousist of four integuments containing a mass of very delicate,
spongy‚ compressible cellular tissucj subdivided into four cqual triangular por-
tions by four lines radiating from the ceutre In the centre of each of these
portions is a cavsty, and projecting into each of these eavitics are a number of
uipple-like processes, which are attached in each cavity to a etuniuon recep-
mole, whilst this, again, is connected with an open, rig-id, cellular tissuc‚ that
lies between the spongy tissue, before described⁷ and the involucrum² and serves
as a connexion between the two (lxm. XXXV. fig. 29). As the involucrum
advances, the spongy tissue recedes all round the four cavitics, which con-
sequently become laiger, and afford more space for the growth of the nipple-

like processes. This secession of the spougy tissue is not caused by the pressure
