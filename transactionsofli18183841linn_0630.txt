53ss Mr. ans οη some new Brazilian Plants

to the genus Bai-mannia. The plants Ι aiu about to describe will bc found
to possess entirely the habit of Bar-mannia in their thickened rhizoma with
branching fibrcs, an erect¹ stein almost naked‚ or at most furnished with a few
bracteiforni leaves, and terminal flowers with a tubular petaloid pei-ianthium,
having a six-parted border coniposed of three sepals and three petals; sta-
mens three, almost sessile in the mouth of the tube of the perianthium below
the petals; anther-cells disjoined, opening transversely; style simple3 three
stigmata3 capsule siu·1n(‘›nnted by the withered perianth bursting irregularly;
and seeds minute, resembling those of Orclzidew. But-mannia, however, pos-
sesscs a trilocular capsule, with muniemus seeds attached to a eentral
placenta formed hythe united margins of the dissepimeuts, while in all my
plants the capsule is always one-celled, the seeds being attached to three
thickened parictal 1)lza·e11tae‚-—a differeuce of no small amount. They vary
inoreover froin But-mannia iu the mode of dehiscence of the capsule, and in
other respects, as will shortly appear.

Before eniel-ing on the description of the plants which form the subject of
this paper, I will notice those before-mentioned recorded by ΜΓ. Nuttall and
Dr. Blumc. That os the former is described in the ‘⁶ Journal of the Academy
of Natural Sciences of Pl1iladelpl1ia‚” vii. p. (54, under the name of Aptere'a
setacea. Having seen it only in a dried state, ΜΓ. Nuttall was not able
to ascertain the particular structure of the stamen& but he describes it as
having a similar petaloid perianthium, without the winged appendages of
But-numni«, au inferior ovary‚ a simple style, a three-lobed stigma, an erect
stein with a few scattered bracteiform leaves: the ‹lifference from Rem-mannia,
however, is striking in the structure of the capsule; for instead of its being tri-
locular with eentral placentation‚ it is unilocular with parietal placentation.

Dr. Blume's plants are described in his Enumeratio Plantarzcm Jarw.
Gymnas-ipsum, froin its unilocular capsulc and parietal placentation‚ will
arrange with the plants which Ι am about to describe. In regard to Gony-
(mtlzes, I confess that Ι could not¹ clearly comprehead that author's definition
of it until 1 had examined some specics of the genus. The following is his
character, slightly moditied fron] luy own observations 2—-
