whole life, and boasts of the lightness and precision of his Sarbacan, as we
hoast of the same qualities in our fire-ar111s.''

The Indian selects only the young reeds for his weapon‚ as the lai-ger would
not only prove too unwieldy when encased, but would likewise require too
much effert in propelling the arrow through the tube. After they have been
cut to the necessary length, they are turned slowly over a moderate coal fire,
which process prevents their warping, and are then exposed to the sun, where
they are allowed to remain until they acquire a shining yellow colour, which
the Indian considers as a proof that they contain no more moisture. They are
afterwards encased3 for which purpose they use the trunk of a slender palm
of the tribe of Arecinw (a Kanthi« or Gemma), which is steeped for a few
days in water in order more easily to extract the lax tissue of which the inside
consists, while the outer part is so hard that it takes a beautiful polish. This
case is called by the Macusi Indians Yi'lrl'ia-Cura- pong.

Mr. Schomburgk having placed in my hands specimens of the Grass which
forms the subject of his connnunication‚ with a request that (if I should find
it to be unpublished) Iwould describe it, Ι at first suspected it to be iden-
tical with the Arundinaria verticillata of Nees von Esenbeck and Kunth;
hut a subsequcnt examination has satisfied me that it is a distinct species of
that genus. I have had no opportunity of comparing it with specimens of
A. *verticillatsg hut it differs from the description of that species given by the
two eminent botanists above-named, in the following particulars. Its leaves
are linear, instead of lanceolate, and smooth on both sni-faces, instead of sca-
brous3 the mouth of their sheaths is furnished 011 either side of the articula-
tion of the leaf with a fringe of long rigid setae, which are not mentioned as
ocem-ring in „Lem-ticillatcm its locustae are sessile, instead of being pedicelled;
and the hypogynous scales are lanceolate and acute, instead of obovate and
obtuse. The following character will therefore serve to distinguish the spe-
cies :—
