of the growing processes‚ for it is frequently in advance of them ι but it is pro-
duced by a gradual condensation, inherent. to the tissuc, around the calvities
and along· the radiating dividing lines, which, in fact, are nothing· more than the
result of this condensatum, which at maturity is so complete, that the whole of
the spongy tissue is condensed into four dissepiments, dividing the cavity of the
involucrum into four equal loculi (Tm. XXXV. fig. 3‹‘›.). The nipplc-like pro-
cesses are found upon a careful examination to be hollow sacs with obscurely
cellular walls, those which occupy the lowest part of the involucrum being*
considerably in advance of the upper ones, These sacs contain a quantity of
grumous matter, and a number—perhaps about ten—of soft, rather opake
pulpy bodies, which are evidently compounded of four closely connected parts,
so placed 011 each other as to form a cone with a triangular base (Tm. XXXV.
fig. 31 & 32). These bodies have their future development in two different
ways, according, in a great measure, to the position they oceupy in the involu-
crum. Those which occupy the upper portion, although not absolutely confined
to that portion, enlarge, become pellucid, and recede from each other, but eon-
tinue to be attached to each other by four stalks as long· as half their diame-
ter, which meet in one eentre (TAss. XXXV. fig. 33.). It is now evident that
these four bodies or sporules are contained in a mother-cell, which most pro-
bably existed before, but on account of its close approximatiou to the four
united sporules could not be scen. On the surfaces of each of these sporules
are three short lines which radiate from the insertion of the stalk. From an
observatiou of the sporules of [metes (cleastris, I am inclined to believe that
these lines are a slight ridge caused by the projection of the membrane into
the interstices between the three other sporules, and that the stall< is a draw-
ing-out, as it were, of the same membranc, some evidence of which is seen in
the instance represented at ΤΛΒ. XXXV. fig.34. At length the mother-cell is
ruptured‚ and the sporules separate from each other at the point where the
stalks meet in one centre, so that each sporule is furnished with a short tail,
which, however, soon disappears (ΤΛΒ. XXXV. fig. 34). A deposit, gradually
takes place on the outer surface of the sporule, forming a second coat, which
gradually becomes more and more opake, until the three radiating lines are
quite invisible, and the sporule a perfectly opake white body (ΤΛΒ. XXXV.
fig. 35 ἃ 3‹5.). Until the sporules have become opake they are quite empty,
