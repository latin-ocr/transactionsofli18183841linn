The genus Anthndiseus was established by G. F. W. Meyer in his Primitia-
Flmw Essequeboensis, p. 193, for a Guiana tree, which he places in [casandria
on account of the insertion of the stamina: “annulo calycino germen cin-
gentes* Ile compares it in that class with some *Um-tacere, with Aeneia, and
with I'lz'zstolaccm but in a natural arrangement it differs widely from the first.
in its free ovarium, from Aeneia in its polycarpous structure, from Plzgstolaeca
by the dichlamydeous perigonium. Since Meyer, it appears to have been
generally overlooked, not being mentioned by De s'undolle either amongst
his Tlmlsmig‘flmw or amongst the polypetalous ΟιζιχσξῘΙυιγυ, and being entirely
omitted by Barthng, Lindley and others in their enumerations of genera.
Sprcng'el took it up, however, in his «Siluema, and Meisner introduces it into
his (ieneric Tables as a spurious Rosaceous plant, allied also in its (imper-
fectly known) fruit to Plrlstolacca.

Amongst Schomburgk's specimens is one which answers so well in external
chwacters to Meyer-'s description of his Anthodiscus trg's'oliatus, that I have
little doubt of its being the same specics, more especially, as I find a similar
specimen in Dr. Linslley's herbarium, proceeding, l believe, from Mr. Parker's
Demcrara collection. These specimens differ, however, from Meyer's charac-
ter in some points of structum, perhaps not much attended to at that time,
but which are now of considerable importancc in a natural arrangement.
The disk from which the statuens arise is hypogynons, not pci·igynous‚-—a cir-
cumstance that removes the plant at once from Rosaceoe3 and the general
