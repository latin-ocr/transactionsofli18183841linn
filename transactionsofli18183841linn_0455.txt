with some Remarks οη the Nature thlte Spongiae Marinae. 379

moving sporules ot' the River Sponge cannot be considered as affording any
test decisive of their animal nature; but, on the contrary, from the manner in
which they began to vegetam, I ain most fully authorized in holding them to
possess far greater affinity with certain seeds, which are well known to belong
to several Algoe or Cryptogamous plants.

Ι will now offer to you a few remarks on the locomotive gei-mlike bodies
of the Sea Sponges, as observed by Dr. Grant, because they bear so consider-
able an analogy with those similar bodies, of which I have before given a
separate detail.

That acute naturalist has called them the ova of the Sponges, and has de-
scribed them* as being quite visible to the naked eye, of a yellow or umber
colour, somewhat translucent, egg-shaped, and tapering more or less at. their
narrow end. Their whole outer surface is covered with delicate projecting
cilia, except their smaller extremity 01· base, which is supposed to be entirely
destitute of them†. then viewed through a microscope, it is seen that the
rapid vibration of the cilia produces a distinct current in the water, which
always flows from their rounded towards their tapering end. They swim
about by means of these cilia, always carrying their broadest ext1·e1nity‡ or
top forwards: they glide along with a regular and smooth 1notion; sometimes
they come to the surface, and sometimes revolve round their axis. At length
they fix themselves to a favourablc spot, and, losing entirely their original
form, become a flat transparent ᾖΙιηᾷ, through which the fibres shoot.

Edinb. Phil. Journ. for 1325; p. 154 of the Edinb. New Phil. Journ. for 18263 and p. 129 of the
same Journal for 1827.

ζ All the germlike bodies of the Sponges and the gemmules of the Zoophytes swim with their
rounder ends or tops precedent. The reason of this I believe is, that those ends are the lightest3 and
their lower or tapering extremities, being filled with the opake and vital substance, are consequently
the lieaviest.

ξ This mode of growth and development very greatly resembles that which takes place with the
seeds or sporules of the Fuci. Stackhouse in his Nereis Britannica (fasciculus ii.) relates a curicus
experiment on the germination of the sporules of some species of Fucus, and adds, ‘⁸ In less than a
week a thin membrano was discoverable on the surface of the pebble, where the seeds had lodged,
with the naked eye; this gradually extended itself, and turned to a darkish olive colour, It con-
tinued increasing in size, till at last there appeared mucous papillae or buds coming up from the mem-
