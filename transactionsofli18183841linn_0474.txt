animal lodged within it. It would therefore be just as erroneous to decide
that this substance is of an animal nature. merely from its smelling, on drying,
somewhat like carrion, as it would be to declare that the Phallas impudicus
among the Fzmgi, and the flowers of the Stapelia variegata amongst the Pha-
nerogmnia, are both really animals, or, at all events, animal producti0ns; for
who, having once experienced the filthy odours given out from both these sin-
gular plants, did not. instantly recognise their nauseous resemblances With the
most foetid and putrid animal matter?

Likewise, some may perhaps be led to infer the animal nature of the Spon-
gillw from the numerous spicula, which constitute a not unimportant portion of
their composition, and considering that thoy are, if not identical, at¹ least ex-
ceedingly analogous with those similar bodies, which are abundant in the
structures of some of the Polypifcrous Alcyonia, but these spicula (lo by no
means afford a sole indication of an animal substance, because many vegetable
productions are well known to secrete the like particles, which are termed
raplzides* by modern botanistS.

Lastly, those naturalists who consider with Montagu† the likelihood of the
Freshwater Sponge being the nidus, matrix, or production of some unknown
inscct or animal, and which surely might even at this day receive some
slightly additional weight 1rom my discovery of the anomalous inseet here al-
ready describedss, I would beg to remind, that my successful experiments ofhav-
ing raised, or grown, young Spongilloe from their seedlike sporidia and locomo-
tive sporules, have in the most complete manner negatived such a supposition.

WVherefore, my late researches on the Spongillctfluviatilis have at length
forced me to secede from my favourite and early opinion concerning its ani-
mal nature, and to adopt that of its vegetability: of the correctness of which,

louring matter remaining pale and unchanged when kept in the dark ; from
its sporules or reproductive bodies possessing the faculty of locomotion, like

cula of the Spongcs are composcd, either of cai-bonate of lime, or of silica.
