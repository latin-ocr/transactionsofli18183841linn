Mr. Hooe's Observations on tlte Spongilla fluviatilis. 369

as brought forward by the first author may be learnt 111 pei-using the ‘ Obser-
vations sur la Spongille romense (Spongilla ramosa, Lanmrck3 Epltydatia ία-
vastris, Lamouroux), par M. Dutrochet‚’ “Annales des Scicnces Naturelles‚''
p. 205. tom. xv„ 1828. But the only notice Ι can find of M. Gervais's opinion
is contained in a very late paper by M. Dujardin, published in the second
series of the same Annales, tom. x. Zool. p. ll. And I should moreover re—
mark, that Baron Cuvier, in both editions of his “ Regne Aniinal‚” has made
no mention of the Slmngilloe, or Freshwater Sponges, and llas expressly de-
scribed ‘⁶ les Eponges'' as being ‘⁶ corps marius ’‘fi'' 'We must then conclude
that 116 had entirely overlooked the1n; or, what is more pmbable, that he had
considered that they are plante, and therefore were not the subjects of his work.

Dr. Johnsmn, as will bc seen from his beautiful book entitled “ A History
of the British Zoophytes‚'' which has only just been given to the world, at
p. 28, 51111 retains the same views on this subject as he did 111 1116 work to
which Ι have before referred.

Next‚ it becomes me (however unwilling I may originally have been to en-
tertain such an opinion†) to state, that I now feel satisfied this species of
Freshwater Sponge 15 truly a plant, and not either a simple individual animal,
or a group of aggregated au'nnals, or the structure or production of any animal
whatsoever. Many careful and repeated experiments upon different specimens
of the Spongilla fluviatilis have at length convinced 1116 that such 15 the real
nature of it; and the results of those experiments Ι will here, as briefly and
clearly as I am able, detail to you.

About seventeen months ago, I observed that the green colonring matter in
the River Sponge was occasioned by the action of light, because saud-coloured
or pale brown specimens gradually became green by being subjected to the
daylight, and more especially so when exposed to the full rays of the sun:
whilst‚ 011 the contrary, pale specimens, when confined in a dark place, or

† It 15 almost unimportant to remark that in my short catalogue of Ροῖμρανίιι, published in my
“ Sketch of the Natural History of the Vicinity of Stockton-on-Tees,'' Stockton, 1827, it will besuoticed
that Ι arranged the genera Sponyia and Sponyilla in my last order, Gelatimjfera, of family 3. Creatoi-
dea, section ii. Composita. Since Dr. Johnston has given the synonyms and references to that cata-
logue in his “ British Zoophytes,’' I may perhaps be cxcused for adding this note.
