from time to time 011 Equiselwn hyemale and other speeies) l shall endeavour
to show that the tilainents attached to the speres of Equis-etum are separated
portions of an oval integument which envelopes the spore in its early state,
and which, being attached to it on one side, and opening by spiral sutures or
>lits as the spore approaches to maturity, finally on its escape from the theca
unrolls, and separates into two filaments with clavate tips attached by their
middle to the spere. When the. spike or f1·u‹.·titieation of Equiselum hyemale
first begins to swell beyond the τρι-11111131 511υειῐ11, the spores may be observed
111 a rudimentary state on caret'ully dissecting the theca, the interior of which
is at this time divided into cells of extreme tenuity, in which the spores
originate. These cells are tilled with a viseid, greenish-coloured fluid, which,
when mixed with a small portion of water and highly magnified, will be found
to contain innumerable minute granules, possessing spontaneous motion, and
moving apparently on their axes with considerable rapidity: they are of various
sizes (fig. 5.) and of various shapes, the larger generally oblong, the [esser sphe-
rieal : they are all equally active, and being transparent, they communicate a
whitish colour to the water when viewed with the naked eye.

Tm. XXXIX. fig. 3. represents four cells detached by means of water, con-
taining the speres in the position which they occupy within the cells-3 at first
their form is oval or ovate, but they very soon change to globular, the form
which they afterwards retain. It is extremely difficult at this time to (letach
any of these cells entire, owing to the filmy condition of their walls and the
vis-eid nature of their contained fluid: a better opportunity is afforded of view-
ing their form and arrangement by macerating the theca in dilute nitrie aeid,
when they appear soniewhat shrunk and collapsed, and the minute granules
are therefore easily discernible in the cells (ΓΑΒ. XXXIX. fig. 4.) and also in
the spores: the whole mass is easily forced asunder even to the theca, which
separates into parts corresponding with the sides of the outer cells. Consider-
able changes take place in the spores from the state here noticed in their
progress to maturity3 these are accompanied by other and very remarkable
changes in the theca as well as in the cells. These latter gradually acquire
substance, separate from each other, and, ehanging their form, become first
globular, and afterwards oval integuments of the sporcs3 the spaces caused by
their separation being filled up with a dark green viscid fluid containing
