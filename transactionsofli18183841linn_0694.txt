The above inseet appears to be the female of some hitherto unknown Lura-
111‹.s·; there is an iimnature variety of it with dark mahogany-coloured wings
in Mr. Grillith's collection,

IIaving now described ten new speeies of Lucanus from Assam, Ι proceed
to add some few ohservations respecting the group.

M. Latreille divided Lea-(oms into two. and ΜΓ. W. Sharp Mat-Leay into
five snb-families. The latter author also formed two sections of Lucana-52
according as the elul) of the antenna consisted of three or four articulations:
a third semion ought: to be added, when the leallets of the elnb comist of five
jairus, with the addition of a spnrlike joint sueceeding them. Now as Laca-
maes lan-smmi anal five other speeies have the elnb consisting of five leaflets,
there is ample ground for instituting a third set-tion, whieh may therefore
properly he ‹lenominated Pentaplzgslla. There can be little doubt that the
above inseet must eventually be formed into a distinet. genns3 but as at pre—
sent I am merely deseribing speeies, Ι pass onwards to more material points.
ff‘lmnberg, in his Monograph of Lucanus, published in the first volume of the
Moseow Transacffions, forms his three divisions from the characters of the
mandibles; by which it appears, first⁷ that they are fureate ς’ seeondly, simple,
with the inner side (lentated3 and thirdly‚ simple and unarmed. Sueh are
the leading¹ characters adopted by authors in their snbdivisions of Lucanus.
It appears to me, however, that other points well worthy of attention have
been neglected (some, indeed, Ι may say, almost entirely omitted); namely,
those which relate to the absence 01· presence. of armature on the tibiae. Ι

therefore here reeonnnend them to notice.
