THE discovery of a species in a hemisphere where the group to which it
belongs has not hitherto been supposed to be iudigenous, 15 always interest—
’ ing, even if only considered with reference to the geographical distribution
of the objects of nature. then, however, as 111 1110 case of the insect about
to be brought before the notice of the Linnean Society, the species dis-
eovered belongs to a most anomalous tribe, and is itself one of the 111051

speeies are known, has hitherto been met with only in the Eastern hemisphere,

botanical treasurcs have already so much occupied the attention of the So-
ciety, has been so fortunate as to bring home an 1115001 of this family from
5011111 America belonging to the genus Cerapterzffi, but evidently possessing
subgeneric characters distinet from those of the known species of that genus.

In my Monograph of this family I described three species of this genus:

and Donovan, and C. H01'gfielflii ; having, however, no absolute means 01110101·-
