The temporalis is an extremely powerful muscle, arising from

N-

the whole latera} part of the fronto-parieta] hone, the median erest
of which is developed for the purpose of increasing the sui-face of
attachment, and consequently the bulk of the principal closer of
the jaws. Small muscles pass from the ascending process of the
upper maxillary to the under surface of the single intermaxillary
110116, which they (16111655, and thereby serve to infix the sharp and
516111161· intermaxillary 166111 111 1116 prey of the Lepidos-iren. The
analogue of the birenter mavillw is a penniform 111115616, and takes
its origin from the 11111161· and 011161 surface of the tympanic bone:
it is inserted into the 011161· part of the lower jaw near the angle,
and opens the mouth. Small choanoid muscles are attached to
the base of the cartilage of each filamentary fin.

c. Bone representing the anchylosed anterior and posterior basi-

d. Pterygoid abutment, which is 11616 a process of the superior maxil-
lary arch.

ρ. Cartilaginous pedicle and joint of the lower jaw‚ strengthened ex-
