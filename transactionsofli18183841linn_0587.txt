ἶ FIND, upon resuming the examination of Messes, which I had given up,
that Ι have not done Mohl justice in the note attached to my paper ‘⁵' 011 the
Devclopn'ient of the Theca and on the Sexes of Mosscsg' puhlished in the
preceding volume of the Socicty's Transactious. In that note Ι have stated,
that Ι thought Mohl was mistaken where he describes the sporules as being
developed by fours in a mother-cell, helieving that he had taken the several
masses of granular eontents, which may be in many iustanccs observcd in a
sponde, as so many distinct sporules. l am now bound to confirm the accu-
racy of Mohl's ohservation in this respect ; and I bcg7 through you, to offer to
the notice of the »Society a remarkable instance of the tetrahedral uuion of the
sporules as au appendix to my former paper. The subject of the following
account 15 OE'dipmlimn Grg'ffi'tlziamaetn, which, from my residencc being near
Snowdon‚ where it 15 found plentit'ully‚ Ι was enahled to examine in a recent
state.

A transverse Section of a very young theca (Tm. XXXV. fig. 9.) shows
several eonccntric layers of cells in strict coutact with each other. The
outer layer 15 slightly tiuged with [Ji-own, and 15 the true theca: the two
next, the outer of which is pellucid, and the inner tinged with green granules,
constitute the thecal memhrane. The sueceeding layer of cells also contains
green granules, and the next 15 pellucid3 these two form the sporular mem-
hrane. Independcnt of the number and sequence, of the layffls, by which we
may decide in this state of the theca which will ultimately form the distinct
sporulm· and thecal membraness the presence of the green granules suffi-

ciently identifies them3 for if we examine a longitndinal Section of a ripe
