:374 Mr. Hooo's Obserz-ations οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

Now the opinion which first struck me was the actual identity of these two
bodies; that is to say, that the latter are only a younger and less mature
condition of the former bodies3 and this indeed appeared to me not impro-
bable, considering that (although the same mass of Sponge 1105505505 111 1110
5111110 11011011 both 50115) 1110) 110111 111 certain of their stages niutually approach
very near in appearance and size to each other3 for I have noticed in the
same fresh specimen the least seedlike bodies to be of a white 0010111 with
their envelopes soft and destitute of any apparent 0111100 111 111011· 10115.

Agaln, the largest germlike bodies which I have seen were more globular
in their 51111110, without any terininal 0111100, having the enveloping mem—
branes, except a very small portion at their upper extremities‚ no longer
transparent, by reason of the quantity of the opake matter having 50 11111011
inci-cased within them: the 0010111· 11150 of some that I preserved 111 51111115
111111 1051 115 original wffiteness, and changed to a yellowish brown or buff, the
most usual colom· of the full-grown seedlike bodies. Hence my grounds for
supposing that the germlike bodies 1110 only early forms of the seedlike bodies,
which they would ultimately become when either sufficiently matured or at
their proper 50115011 of the yearsst.

To this, however, there is one objecfflon, namely, the absence of all papillae
in the one, and the presence of them in the other: yet I think it not un-
likely that the seedlike bodies once possessed those organs3 for on being
highly magnified, their 011101 5110115 appear indented with small dots, which
make me rather imagine that they are the spots where the papillae may have
originally been attached, but which, on the maturity of those bodies, either
all or part decayed or enlarged into 1111105, whcreby they are fastened† within
intermixed with very small granulcs (111051 probably the young locomotive germlike bodies), which also
seem 10 0011111111 a particle of the 5111110 1011), that will increase with the growth of the granules, after
they may have 0501111011 from the former body. Now 1 think, from my own observations„ it is clear
that this jelly 15 alone the sepi-oductive or vital portion from which the substance of the sponge itself
originates.

* Of course many of these would never ripen into seedlike bodies: viz. those which have emerged
from the 110105 and 011111115 of the parent structure. and having swuni to a convenient spot, there begin
to grow. These form an exception to the above 50111105111011, which can only apply to such numerous
germlike bodies as cannot escape from the fibrous network of the Sponge.

† Some of the fixed seedlike bodies frequently become dctached by the dec-ay of their connecting
fibres or tubules; by the buri-owing and tearing of 11150015, and other parasitical animals; or by the
