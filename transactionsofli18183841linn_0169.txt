Muridae3 on the hind feet there are three 1005 011 1110 same line and of the
same length, and at a considerable distance behind these, a well-developed
internal toe, furnishcd with 0 distinet claw, and apparently a smaller or rudi-
mentary one, without a claw, on the 011101· 51110 of the tarsus. Of this latter„
however,I 0111 by no means certain, for it is diffieult to distinguish, in a
sketch, like that from Which the principal part of this description 1105
110011 taken, the differenee between 0 rudimentary 100 of this nature, and
the small fleshy pads usually found 011 1110 50105 of such animals. If it
exist at all, however, the external 100 111 question must be a mere tubercle;
but for my own part, though Ι have here thought proper to describe the
appearance exaetly as Ι have observed it 111 1110 51101011, Ι should rather be
inclined to doubt its existence, because rudimentary 1005 of that description,
where they do exist, are generally found on the inner side of the soot, and Ι
do not rcmember having ever met with a single example of such a clawless
tuberele on the outer surfaee. In either case the character of the 1005 will
readily distinguish the Dilms Jlitcleellii from the rest of its eongenersf, there
is no known ι1011100 which 1105 0 clawless or tuberculous 100 011 1110 1111111 [0011
01111 1110 only other species with which it could possibly be confounded, the
Dilms tem-adactgslas of Liehtenstein, has the additional 100 011 1110 extcrnal
instead of the internal surface of the tarsus. That species is indicated as an
inhabitant of the Libyan desert, where it was found by Drs. I‘Iemprich and
Ehrenberg3 the five-toed 51100105 are all natives of the plains of Central Asia
and Southern Siberia, 01111 11 15 not a little singular that we should find the
same type reproduced in the interior of Δ1115100110. The Dipus Mitchellii was
found at. Reedy Plains, near the ι1011011011οΐ the Murray 01111 1110 Murrum-
bidgee, on the northern boundaries of Australia Felix.

But Ι may be asked for a further justification of 1110 0111111011 here 01111011110011,
05 10 1110 existence of a true Dipzcs in Ausa-alia, founded as this opinion 15
upon 1110 authority of a mere drawing; and Ι confess that the question 15 110111
just and pertinent. It. might, indeed, be suspected, with some show of pro-
bability, that since the country is already known to abound 111 ›Saltigi-ade
Marsupials, the animal in question may really belong to that form, and be
more nearly allied to the Kangaroo rats than 10 the Rodentia. That the
animal may eventually turn 0111 10 110 Marsupial is not impossible: but, 111111·-
