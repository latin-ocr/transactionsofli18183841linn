468 Mr. E. J. QUEKETT on the Ergot of Rgse,

fected, it is conceived that the foi-egoing remarks have demonstrated that this
body 15 produced by a particular species of fungus³ which develops itself
when it occupies the grain (whilst young), causing 115 remarkable alteration
in form, colour, chcmical composition and properties.

The manner in which 11115 singular production probably originates (for at
present much respecting this part remains uncertain) 15, that the sporidia, or
inore likely the nuclei within 1110111, are by some means introduced into the
interior of the ‹grassssss< and ultimately arrive at the grain, which they find
the most 51111111)Ιο matrix for their development ; 01· they may be brought into
eontaet with the young grain from without, probably by the viseid fluid‚ 11111
11115 15 1055 likely to be the 01150, 115 1110 01·ςο1 01111 110 1101001011 before the palere

When, however, they have becn brought into contact with it, they 1050 110

ing its body with 111111111111105 of sporidia, and coinmunicating disease to the
healthy 1155110, 111111 thereby destroying 511 11111011 of the 001115 as in the perfect

Phcebus gives a more extensive 1151 than the above, amongst which he enumerates several kinds of

⁴³¹³ It 15 stated by Phoebus. and by Christiffln in 1115 ’110111150 011 Ρο150115, 21111 01111., that &Viggers had
produced ergots by infer-ring the healthy grains previously with the sporidia. Leveille 11150 states
(p. 57⁴), op. cin), ‘¹ M. Simonnet 5’011 est 115511κο par une experience tres-simple, qui consiste a percer
aree unc epinglc la partie inferieurc de chaque fleur qui contient ce 5110. Constamment cet ob-
>e1·vateur a vu l'crgot s'y developper.” Τ1115 last experiment 15 1101 cf much value, for it generally
happens that where the riscid juice exists there will be an ergot³ whether a puncture has been made
or not: the experiment ought to have been performed on 111050 grains not moistened by any viscid
juice.

Mr. Bauer (Penny Mag. 18:33, p. 120 and 182) has shown from interesting and delicate experi-
11101115, 111111 1110 ¹‘ 5111111-1111115” 011 corn can be certainly produced by inoculating the 500115 before sow-
ing them with the 5110111105 of the fungus producing 511011 effects, viz. sredoswffllu and seqetzmm and
11115 excellent observor 11115 proved 111111 111050 bodies are carried into tlic interior by the sap after being
