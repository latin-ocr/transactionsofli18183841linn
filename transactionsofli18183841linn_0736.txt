ἑᾶς breadth of abdomen 3¹31? length of an anterior leg ἧς length of a

leg of the third pair ᾗ.

Cephaio-thorax oval, glossy, depressed on the sides, which are marked with
slight furrows diverging from the upper part towards the margins; in
the medial line of the posterior region there is an indentation. Mandi-
bles 00111001, 01111011 with 100111 011 1110 1111101· sui-face, and inclined towards
the sternum, which is broad and beart-shaped. Maxillae inclined towards
the lip, which is semicircular and prominent at the extremity. First and
fourth pairs of legs the longest, and equal in length, third pair the
5111111051. Antei-ior intermediate eyes the smallest of the eight. The tarsi
of this 51111101, and of all 1110 51100105 belonging to the genus which have
come under my observation, are tcrminated by three claws; the two
superior ones curved and pectinated, and the inferior one inflected near
its base. Abdomen thinly clad with hairs, glossy, convex above, projeet-
ing over the base of the cephalo-thorax. This 51100105 15 1110011, with the
exception of 1110 mandibles, maxillae, legs, and palpi, which are brown,
the first two being much the dai-kest.

ΤΙ10 1111110 15 rather smaller than 1110 female, but resembles her 111 0010111,
and in the relative length of his legs. The anterior part of the cephalo-
thorax, where the eyes are situated, is elevated‚ but obtuse, with an oblong
indentation on each side, extending backvvards from the laterai eyes.
Third and fourth joints of the palpi short, the latter being much the
sti-onger3 tifth joint oval, convex and hairy externally, 00110ον0 within,
eomprising the palpal organs, which are highly developed, complicated
in structure, with a very prominent, filiform‚ curved, black spine, enve-
loped in a delicate mernbrane, originating about the middle of the outer

side, and a short, straight, pointed 0110 at their extremity3 they are of a
reddish brown 0010111.

Both sexes of ΖΗΛ-1011110111 atra, the males having the palpal organs fully
developed, were found 111 May 1838, under stones in moist pastures near
Llanrwst. The species probably comes near Ther-idion aczmzinatum, wider, in
Mus. Senk. i. p. 23⁴2. t. 15. f. ll.
