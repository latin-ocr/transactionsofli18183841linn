IN Pohl's Plantammz Brasilioe leones, vol. ii. pl. 157, 153, and 159, three
plants are figured under the nanie of Stemmatosiplzon, and referred to Alleliamw,
on account of some similarity in the disposition of the stamina and the form
of the corolla, if considered as polypetalous. Adrion de Jusffleu, however, in
a note added to his excellent ineinoir on Jleliacew (illem. (lu Α11ης. vol. xix.
p. 152.) adverted to the simple leaves, indefinite stamina, &c.‚ as incompatible
with that family; but, inisled by several errors in the details of structure
figured by Pohl, was unable to point out satisfactorily the group to which it
should be removed*. On the occasion of determining the plants collected in
Guiana by Mr. Schomhurgk, I was struck with the apparent affinity of one of
thern to the speciinens of Pohl's Stemmatosipllons, which I had obtained at
Vienna, and was led into an exainination of that genus, which proved to he
identical with the Linnean Sisnzplocos, as first constituted, although differing
in many points from many of the other species which have since been asso-
ciated with it.

The genus Symplocos was originally founded hy Jacquin, and adopted by
Linnaeus, for the S. 711a1·t1’›11'cens1'.s·, which was thus characterizet] hy Linnaeus
in his Genera Plantarum: “Periantlzimn inonophylluui, seiniquinquefidum‚
parvum, laciniis subrotundis erectis. Petalu quinque, oblonga, obtusa, erecta,
superne patentissima. Filanzenta plurima, subulata, plana, petalis breviora,

* The remarkable circumstance in particular of a trifid stigmate, with a quadrilocular ovarium,
figured in each of the three plates, does not exist in any flower that I have dissected of either os the
species.
