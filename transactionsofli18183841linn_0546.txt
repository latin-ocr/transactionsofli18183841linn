leaving the field of view, but possessing a tremulous movement‚ slowly ap-
proaching and retreating about their neighbours.

Having witnessed this for some time, and satisfied myself that the move-
ments were such as are common to particles known as “ active 1noleeules‚” the
object was set aside, covered with the piece of mica used in the previous ob-
sta-ration, and placed under an inverted glass to prevent the evaporation of the
water.

(‘)u examining it. the next day, it was found that a few still retained similar
movements to those witnessed the previous day, but the greater number pre-
sented appearanees of commencing germination, in the various ways which
here follow.

The most common method is that of the sporidia emitting a tube or tubes
from some uncertain point or points (TAB. XXXIII.B. fig. 4.), but generally
opposite the spot where a green granule is lodged in the interior. This tube
inereases to an uncertain length, and contains throughout its interior similar
granules, arranged at short but generally cqual distances between diaplnagms,
about as far from each other as they are in the interior of the sporidia3 these
tubes ultimately separate into fragments constituting as many fresh reprodue-
tire bodies.

In many other instances the sporidia, instead of producing a tube, give ori-
gin, opposite one of the granuleS, to a minute bud ; this little point increases,
becomes hollow‚ and ultimately separates from the parent as a perfect spori-
dium, frequently however before its separation showing an indication of pro-
ducing a similar one from itself. (lxm. XXXIII. B. fig. 5.)

Another method of increase amongst these singular gei-ms is that of the
membrane composing the parietes of one of the sporidia breaking down,
forming a flat pateh, which keeps extending in all directions for a certain

period, and developing upon itself granules, similar to those contained in the
interior of the sporidia (fig. 6.).

The last and most remarkable manner of growth is that of the sporidia
having a septum formed transversely across their interior, by a green granulo
extending itself laterally‚ and dividing them into two parts, eaeh of which
becomes again (livided by a similar process; different states of which are re-
presented in TAB. XXXIII. B. figg. 7, 8, δι 9. By a repetition of this and other
