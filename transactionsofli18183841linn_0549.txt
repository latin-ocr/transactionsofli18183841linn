ergot that occupies this position ought to be certainly 110 other than the grain,
which now differs from its healthy condition, froin having in its early state
supported a parasite which has coininunieated to it 501116 (11561156, thcrcby 1161-
verting the normal state of its structure and development.

Notwithstanding the several parts of the grain arc arranged as described,
previous investigators, with the exception of Leveille, have fallen into the error
that the ergot was the fungus itsclf. Philippar appears to have viewed the
matter in this light; still 1115 expressions are soniewhat vaguc respecting it, for
(p. 122, op. cit.) it is stated, ‘·' Le grain 613016, 6011111056 (1’11116 substance fon-
gique 111556 61 tres 61101161116111 serre, est le receptacle des 5610100165, (165 glo-
bules ou bourgeons reproductcurs du clianipignon.'' In 1116 sanic page the
following expression is used: ‘⁶ lc chanipignon”——“ 50111101 (16 l'intcricur de la

sexuelsf' And lastly (1). 123), 1115 opinion is given thus: “De tout 6661, je
conclus que l'ergot est l'appareil reproducteur (111611011111131100. qui termine
ainsi sa vegetation.”

The reasons assigned by Philippar for considering it a fungus arise froin its
situation and froin the 11116105601116 examination of its structure, which he de-
scribes (p. 113) as beginning in the receptacle of the flower, and lifting up the
sexual organs which 11660016 diseased but 51111 1601010 on 115 apex. It is found,
however, that where the palea· are attached, and also the two scales, this
