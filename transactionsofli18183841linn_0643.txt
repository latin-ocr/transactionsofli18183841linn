doubt; but it appears to me, that if we adopt the principle on which Aposto-
siem have been separated from Orclzideoe and Atyrideoe from Restiaceoe, we
are bound to class the second section as distinct from the first. If this view
be admitted, I should propose to adhere to the suggestion offered by me in
1337, to arrange these new genera into a separate family, which might be
called Apteriuoeoe3 but if, on the contrary, the difference of structure of the
ovarium be not thought a distinction of sufficient importance to warrant their
separation into two famssies, they must then be associated with Burnzanniacew„
giving to the first section the title of Barmanniew, and to the second that of
Apteriew. But I fear that the former view, which at first sight would seem to
rest on a wide and well-founded distinction, will on mature consideration be
found of less value, since the extensive order of Gentianae, for instance,
presents many instances of gradual transition‚ beginning with the unilocular
capsule with parietal placentation‚ the margins of the valves being ovuliferous,
and ending in complete central placentation and a bilocular fruit, showing
numerous cases of intermediate degi-ees of inflection of the ovuliferous mar-
gins.

The only other observation that Ι shall add respecting these plants relates
to the striking resemblance of their seeds with those of most orchideous
plants, and the similarity in texture and structure of the pericarpium, which
in both families will be found to consist of a series of closely-packed trans-
verse ribs, seldom interrupted, proeeeding from the inter-mediate lines where
dehiscence takes place, to the placentie. M1·.Brown has clearly demonstrated
the structure of the ovarium of Orchicleoe to consist of three carpellary leaves
united by their ovuliferous inflected margins. In Dietyostega a similar struc-
ture is evident, only that the margins are not inflected, but are directly united
by their edges, where they appear to be conjoined by an interveniug, opake,
reticulated line, running from the base to the apeX, and forming a support to
the horizontal, transverse, crowded ribs that eompose the walls of the ovariuin ;
immediately within this line is a compact bundle of longitudinal fibres forming
the placenta, upon which the numerous closely imbricatc ovula are attached.
The same structure of the walls of the ovarium is especially visible in many
species of Pleurotlzallis, though in most other Orchideoe the structure of the
walls is very reticulate. In Orclzidew, the thick fleshy substance which fills
