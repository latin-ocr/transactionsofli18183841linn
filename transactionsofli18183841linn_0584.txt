distinguish one bud froin the othei· in the youngest state. All thc
hnds and growing extreinitics of thc hranches are clothed with hairs,
which fall offas the pai-t becomes developed.

Ficr. 21. An involucrum about half 111atni·c(l; it is densely covered with hali-s,
which gradually decay and sall off, so that there are only a few dc-

caycd remnants left on the mature involucrum.

Fig. ⁶29. »Section of a young· involucrum. In this stage the three ontei· coats
are of a very faint hi'own colour, and the innci· quite colourlcss. The
two middle coats are drawn scarcely thick enough. The thecae
contain spornlcs in the first and second stage of develop1nent3 they
arc too opakc, however, to show thcii· contents with any distinct-
ness.

contains both kinds of thecae3 those containing fertile sporulcs, and
those which are occupied by the abortive ones.
