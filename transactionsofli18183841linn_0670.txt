membraneus bag, flattened on two sides, and reticulated in a peculiar man-
ner; six or more thecae surround the pedicel of the peltate scale to which
they are attached, the approximating sides being flattened‚ and the outer and
inner edges prominent. The theca is reticulated in the following manner:
three 01 111016 rows of muriform meshes placed transversely side by side run
along the inner edge (ΤΑΒ. XXXIX. fig. 1.); the ends of these 111651165 are
separated by a zig-zag line (or what proves when highly magnified to 116 11
double line), and it is at one of these lines that the dehiscence of the theca
takes· place (Tin. XXXIX. fig. 14. a.). The meshes occupying the sides and
1111161 edge are of various forms, generally disposed in irregular rows or
dividcd into 111-611116, 1116 111651165 111 611611 01 which have a different inclination:
those 011 1116 011161· edge are placed longitudinally, from which the bundles of
meshes on the sides are variously inclined in 1116 (1116611011 01, 111111 10 111661 1116

tinues until the spores have attained their full size, and are changing to the
dark green colom· which they assume at maturity.

At this time a new deposit of vegetable matter 15 added 10 1116 111611111111116 01
1116 1116611, 111 which spiral vessels are developed: a deposit of green granular
matter is 11151 observed round the edges of the 111651165, 111111 afterwards di-
spersed of a lighter colour over the whole: the development of the spiral
vessels immediately follows this deposit, which seems in a great measure to
116 111150111611 111 1116 process, 115 1116 1116611 afterwards partly regains 115 former
transparency. On first observing this deposit, it appeared to me 10 116 formed
on the inner sursaee of the 111611111111116 of the theca; but after examining both
5111111665 with a magnifying power of four hundred 1111111161615, I found that they
presented exactly the same appearance. Subsequent ohservations‚ however,
have eonvinced me that the meshes of the theca are composed of a double
membrane3 that they are in fact tlattened cells, the united edges os which
form the bonndaries of the 111651165, 111111 111111 1116 deposit 111 question, and
afterwards the spiral vessels, are formed in the space caused hy a partial
separation of the two membranes. This observationi 15 confirmed hy the
appearance of the 111651165, which 111 11115 111116 have more or less of a hlistered
appearance, 01· 1116 wholly inflated, but again collapse as soon as the spiral
vessels are formed. These vessels vary according to the form of the meshes
