does not, however, connnunieate with the sinus, but passes along entire and
adherent to the inner sui-face of the vena cava as far as the auriculo-ventricular
apertum, where it empties its contents into the ventricle by a distinet oritiee‚
protected by a cartilaginous valvular tubcrcle. It needed only that the pnl-
monary vein should have been dilated before its termination in order to have
established a biaurieular structure of the heart, as in the Siren. The same
functioual advantage is, however, thus secured to the Lepidmiren, with a
inaintenance of the simple dicoelous type of the heart of the Fish: the conti-
nuation of the pulmonary vein preventing the admixture of the respired with
the venons blood, until both have arrived in the venti-icle.

The vent1·icle’³« is of an elongated form, truncate anteriorly where it is in
eontact with the bulbus arten-iosus, and with an obtuse rounded apex at the
opposite end: it is four lines in length, and two in breadth. The eavity of
the venti-ieie is extremely small: its parietes arc thick and reticularly muscu-
lar: a small round orifice leads into the bulbus arteriosus. This body† pre-
sents externally a simple transversely oval form: but its interna] structure
is more eomplicated than would be suspected from its external appearance.
It is formed by a short spiral turn of the dilated aorta, which is concealed
under a simple continuous outer fibrous coat: the area of this part of the ves—
sel is almost entirely occupied by two continuous valvular projections, or their
processes, which are attached by one edge to the internal surfaee of the
aorta, and have the opposite margin projecting· freely into the arterial eavity.
If these internal valves were straight, they would resemble the single thicker
valvular process which occupies the elongated bulbus arteriosus of the Siren z
here, however, they follow the spiral turn of the aorta.

The aortass in the present most remarkable species fulfils at once the office
of a systemie‚ abranchial, and a pulmonary artery: it distributes on each side
six vessels corresponding to the six branchial cartilaginous arches. The
mucous membrane is produced into a branchial fringe on the convex side of
the lst, 4th, 5th‚ and 6th branchial arches, and the corresponding arteries are
minutely subdivided before they are continued to the dorsal side of the pha-
rynx: these four pairs of vessels are therefore true or functional branehial
arteries. The mucous membrane merely invests with a simple fold the second
