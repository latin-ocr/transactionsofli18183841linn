Generul Remarlfs.

From what has been stated, it will appear that the ovulum is, both in La-
rantlms and Viscum, a formation subsequent to impregnation. This remark-
able, and, Ι believe, uuparalleled fact, will tend materially to increase the
difficulty of understanding or even eonjeeturing the nature of the first steps in
the formation of an embryo. It is evident that it is at total variance with the
idea that the ovulum, or female organ, is a nidus adapted to, and necessary
for the development of the embryo, which in this view is supposed to be
derived entirely and directly from the male. It is needless to add, that it is
totally different from the usual development of ovula.

With respect to the first part of the process of development, Ι may observe
that original continuity of tissue is very general, aud perhaps universal. And,
iu particular, I believe the nucleus of an ovulum to be ab origine solid ; what
ever is produced subsequently in its interior being developed in a eavity formed
by an excavating process.

Although there can be no doubt from its structure and functions, that the
fleshy body in which the mature embryo is more or less contained is albumen.
yet it. may be proper to state in what part of the tissue the necessary change
is carried 0113 particularly since there is, Ι believe, no instance of albumen
oceurring as a primary formation*.

The albumen in both these genera may, therefore, be classed with those

*- Although I have not proved the existence of a sac in Lorantlms, within which the tissue uhi< h
subsequently becomes the albumen, is formed, yet, from the consideration of Viscum, and from the
obvious analogy which its sac presents to the sae of the amnios in ordinary structures, l have liuh>
hesitation in advancing the opinion that the ovulum in Lormztlws and Viscum is reduced to its simplest
possible state, and that the albumen is a (leposit within the tissue of the amnios, the sac of which has
at an early period ceased to exist, at least as a distinct membrane. Further researches may hereafter

establish the fact of the amnios being the only essential part of an ovulum.
