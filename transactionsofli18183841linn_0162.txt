124 Mr. OGILBY on certain Australian Quadrupeds,

debted, and who has eal-ned the just tribute of public gratitude by a career of
honourable and successful discovery. whatever is most curious and valu-
able in the following observations‚ is mainly due to the liberal and obliging
communications of Major Mitehell, Surveyor-General of New Soutli ividem
and if his name occurs less frequently than it ought to do in the course of the
following pageS, Ι beg it to be distinctly understood that the circumstance
arises entirely fron] a desire to avoid the too frequent repetition of aeknow-
ledgements, which are at all times more easily felt than express-ed.
Ι proceed to the description of the

Genus Οοκιιυιιυε,

a new and interesting form of the Rodent family, with the general characters
of which Ι have long been partially acquainted‚ though it is only froin the
connnunieations of Major Mitehell that Ι am enabled to detail the valuable
particulars of its habits and oeconomy, which will be found in the sequel.
The appellation by which I propose to designate this new genus is eoni-
pounded of the words οὐρὰ and κόινιλοο, (evidently a Greek form of the bur-
barous term Comffi) which occurs in AElian as the name of the common rab-
bit, and is intended to express the resemblance which the animal bears to
a small rabbit with a long tail. My observations are founded upon the
exainination of two speeimens which have long been in the Society's collec-
tion under the name of ‘⁶ the Native Ral›bit,” and which were formerly brought
from New South VVales by the late Mr. George Caley. Both speeimens are
unfortunately without skulls, so that it is impossible for me at present to
establish the characters of the genus upon strictly scientific prineiples3 and
Ι ean only deduce from the form of the claws and feet, the quality of the fur,
and various minor partit-uluis, confirmed, however, by the testimony of Major
Mitchell, that they belong to the Rodent order, and most probably to the
extensive and coniplieated family of ,Um-idco. Like these anhuals, they have
the hind legs considerably longer than the fore, the excess arising prineipally
from the development of the tarsus; four toes 011 the fore feet and live on the
hind, all long⁷ slender, separate, and armed with small weak claws, sharp,
and partially compressed on the sides, but scarcely surpassing the extreniities

of the tocs2 and totally unadapted to habits of burwwing, except, perhaps, iu
