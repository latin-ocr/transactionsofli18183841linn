ff Araehis [md Voandzeia. 157

except that the calyx is rather less deeply 1111111011 ; they are also usually sterile:
at least, after examining several 11011015 of seventeen or eighteen species, Ι have
only once observed a tendency on the part of the style to separate itself from
the 01111111111, 11111151 Ι 111110 continually seen this organ wither and fall off with
the calyx. The fertile flowers of Stylosantlzes also resemble Arachis in the
most important peculiarity that they are entirely without floral envelopes. The
ovarium is, however, nearly sessile between the two bracteolae‚ which always
exist in both genera, and it is terminated by a short hookcd style with a
somewhat thickened stigma. During maturation it swells and separates into
two articulations, without any elongation of the torus.

It is not impossible that the hermaphrodite flowers of *S'igfloszmllzes may also
be occasionally fertile, bnt the hook which constantly terminates the legume
seems to show that it proceeds from the hooked style of 1110 naked 11011015,
111111 not from the straight end of the ovary of the perfect ones.

The chief point. in which Aracleis differs from Hetlsssarew is in the legume,
which does not separate into distinct articulations, a character regarded as ab-
solute in all Hedysm·ece with more secds than one; and this is the reason that,
notwithstanding the remarkable resemblance ofthe flowers to those of Stylosan-
thes, 110 0110 has as yet, to my knowledge, proposed bringing 1110111 together;
but even in this point it will, perhaps, be found that Ararlu's is nearer to He-
dqsarew than to any other tribe. As in the Heclgssarew, it. has no valvular
dehiscence, and its surface is marked with those remarkable reticulations‚
which, as far as I am 11111110, 1110 peculial· to Heclgssarean the young legume is
often very much constrictcd between the seeds ; and even the non-articulation
may be accounted for by the underground maturation‚ a circumstance which
has usually the effect of rendering indehiscent the underground legumes in
amphicarpous species of which the upper legumes are dehiscent.

Voamlzeia 1·ese1nbles Ararlzis in having sterile perfect flowers and apetalous
fertile 01105, which enter the ground to ripen the legumes, it has therefore
been usually associated with sii-achlin and I myself, when studying leseoleae
at Vienna, having no speeimens of I'oamlzeia at the time, referred it with
&illm-anthes to Hedysarese: but in this Ι was 1nistaken; the underground
fruits of most amphicarpons Leguminosoe proceed from apetalous flowers, so
that that character alone would not connect Voandzeia with Araclzis any more
