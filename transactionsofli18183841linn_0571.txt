FROM various causes, particularly removing from North IVales to this
place, I have not had it in my power at an earlier period to reduce my
observations into proper form for your pei-usal. A visit to St. David's would
ainply repay a botanist, as, from what Ι saw, Ι conceive it to bc a rich
locality‚ and, as far as Ι know, not yet explored3 but having on the second
day of my arrival gathered Pilularia glabulg'fhra for the first time in my life,
I determined to bestow all the time I could command on its cxamination,
and therefore Ι did not collect many species. I must beg to remark, that as Ι

tains sufficient novelty to justify its publication.

The involucrum (ΤΑΒ. XXXIV. fig. 2.) of Pilum-ia glolml4'fmw contains two
kinds of bodies, which, however, occupy distinct sacs: one kind (ΤΛΒ. XXXV.
fig. 36.) are round, very numerous, and minute, not larger than the wath part
of an incl] 3 they are found principally in the upper part of the involucrum, and
are about forty in each sae: the other kind (ΤΛΒ. XXXIV. fig. 3.) are of an
oblong pyriform shape, a little constricted near the middle, with a conical
projection at one extremsty, and are much less numerous⁷ about sixty‚ and
occur sing-ly in each sac; they are about the SOth of an inch broad, and have
the power of geriliination, which the former kind (lo not appear to possess.
Both kinds are loose in their sues, and have an opake, pure white, minutely
granular, testaceous covering, and are imbedded in a kind of gelatum, which
