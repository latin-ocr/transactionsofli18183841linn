340 Prqf. OwEN's Description of the Lepidosiren annectens.

face of the brain behind the hemisphcres is an elongated bilobed tract corre-
sponding to the base of the third vena-ide& and posterior to this a single
subsphcrical corpus mammillare†.

The ncrves given off from the hrain are the olfactory3 the optic, which
arise close together from the mesial line, traversing the second hasal mass:
the fifth pair, which are of very large size3 the auditory, and the eighth pair
of nervcs.

The brain bears a closer resemblance to that of the Perennibranchiate Rep-
tiles than to the hrain of any fish which has yet been described. Figures of
the brains of the lllwzopomess and ssletz(›l›1·‹1m·l11‹s3& are added to the plate in
order to illustrate this resemblance, which is very striking as regards the
lll‹»ml1ram·lms on account of the rudimental condition of its cerebellum. In
the low development of this part of the hrain, and in the large size of the
pineal gland, the Lepidosiren deviates in a marked degree both froin the
osseous and cartilaginous fishes.

The olfactory nei-vesi} are inore than twice the size of the optic; they pass
forwards through foramina in the cartilaginous zetlnnoid, and expand upon
the posterior surface of the nasal sales, the pituitary membrane of which is
‹lisposed in two series of short transverse folds, about twenty in each, as
before mentioned: these olfactory sacs have no communication with the buc-
cal cavity.

The optic nerves ἽῘ arise close together, as in the §lx-ate, from the mesial
linc traversing the second hasal mass; they do not decussate as in the osseous
Fishes. They are remarkably small, in correspondence with the feebly-
developed organs of vision. Each eyeball adheres to the skin, with which
the flat cornea is 011 a perfect level: there is a small spherical lens, and a
membranous sclerotic: there is no trace of the vascular body called, in osse-
ous Fishes, the choroid gland. The diameter of the eyeball is about one line
and a half: it has no special muscles, whence thc absence of 3rd, 4th, and (jth
cerebral nerves.

The organ of hearing consists of a large labyrinth excavated in a thick car-
tilaginous case, without other external communication than the foramina for
