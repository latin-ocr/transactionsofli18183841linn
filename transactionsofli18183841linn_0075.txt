THE following observations were made at the Botanic Garden, Calcutta‚ in
the early part of July, 1835.

The ovat-ium as well as the fruit of this genus corresponds with the struc-
ture laid down by Mr. Brown as one of the principal distinguishing marks of
Santalaceoe, of which order I presume this genus is the type.

I allude to the eentral free placenta, bearing towards its apex a definite
number of pendulous ovula. Yet Roxburgh has mistaken the structure eu-
tirely, and has evidently described the placenta together with the ovula, which
he did not see, for the orvedum. This author, in his Flora Indica, vol. i. p. 443,
describes the ovulum as ‘⁶ Germ. semi-superum} one-celled, containing oue
conieal seed attached to the bottom of the cell.” This mistake is perpetuated
in the Botanieal Magazine5 new series, t. 3235, in Which Roxburgh's descrip-
tion is quoted, and said to be faithful. The error of Jussieu with regard to
the ‹az-ulam of Santalaceoe, first pointed out by Mr. Brown in his Prodromus
Floroe Not-ce Hollandioe, and subsequently in the Appendix to Captain Tuekey's
Expedition to Congo, p. 453, might have partly originated from an examina-
tion of Santalnm, in which the ovula from their situation and direction may
very easily be overlooked.

The placenta in this species is conieal, rather obtuse in the young flowers‚
but prolonged considerably in those that are matured. Its apex correspouds
at this period to the termination of the eanal, occupying the eentre of the
style, but not opening between the stigmata in the fully developed flowers,
The ovula are attached near the base, and not towards the apex‚ as in the
other genera of this family. Mr. Brown's statement in Captain Flinders‘s
