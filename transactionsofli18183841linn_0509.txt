The floral organs differ chiefly from those of *S'arracenia in the great reduc-
tion 111 the number of parts. Instead of three distinct series of floral envelopes
(three external bracts‚ five sepals and five petals)‚ Heliamphora has but four,
five, or (as observed by Mr. Schomburgk) six leallets altogether, of which the
external are somewhat thicker and more herbaceous than the more internal
ones, though all are to a certain degree petaloid and coloured. §Vllere there
are, four or five, the oestivation and position is the same as those of the sepals
of is'arracenia, but they are more imbricate, each leaflet overlapping more or
less the next opposite one on one side, even at their insertion. Ι have not seen
any flowers with more than five leaflets, and Ι therefore do not know the poa
sition of the sixth.

The stamens are indefinite, and placed as in Sum-acenia; there were twenty„
one in the flower-bud l opened; from twenty-seven to thirty-two in most
nowers, according to Mr. Schomburgk. The anthers are versatile, turned 111-
wards in the bud, and the cells open longitudinally.

The ovary differs from §inv-acenia in being three-celled only, instead of five-
rel1ed3 in other respects, the number, arrangement, and structure of the ovules
agree perfectly with Sarracenia. The style is erect and cylindrical‚ but is
truncate, and minutely ciliated at the apex: with an obscurely three-lobed
stigmatic surface‚ without any tendency to the remarkable foliaceous expan-
51011 of the stigma of Sarracenia.

I have not seen the capsule of Heliampltmw, but Mr. Schomburgk describes
it 115 “three-celled‚ tbi-ee-valved, with numerous seeds.'' A few ripe seeds
communicated to mc by him arc rather larger than in ›S'(1r1·aceniu flava and
psittacina, the only two species of which I have the fruit* the testa is
brown‚ less tuberculated than in Sarrae-enin, but expanded into a membranous
wing surrounding the seed. The albumen and embryo are the same in both
genera.

From this sketch it will be seen that all the essentiale of arrangement and
insertion of the floral organs, and of the conformation of the ovary and seed,
are as 111 Sarracenia, and place this new plant in the same Order; the differ-
ences in the number of parts cannot here have any other than a generic im-

* The seeds of Sam-areum are described 115 “ minute,'' a vague term. scarcely applicable in this case,
as in both the above-quoted species they are full one line long, and obovoid,
