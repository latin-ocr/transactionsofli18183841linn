at the extremity, 011 the outer side, and slightly so on the inner side:
fifth joint of an elongated oval form, eonvex and hairy externally, con-
cave within, comprising the palpal orgium, which are highly developed,
complicated in structure, with a fine, straight, prominent, pointed spine
near the middle, and one or two slightly curved ones, enveloped ina
semitransparent membrano, at the extremity: they are of a red-brown
colour. Abdomen oviform, eonvex above, projeeting over the. base of the
cephalo—thorax; it is thinly covered with haim, and of a brown-blaek

colou r.

The male of this species, which makes a near approximation to the 'I'lzeridia
in externa] structure, was captured on iron rails at Crumpsall Hall, in October
1836. Ι have placed it, provisionally, in the genus Neriene, till the female
shall be discovered, as the sexes of the same spider frequently differ in the

relative length of the legs and in the form of the maxillae.
