family Dgssderidstg to which it unquestionably appertainS, and of placing it,
together with *S'egestria petfitla and Segestria senoculata, both species of con—

Having endeavoured succinctly to point out the insufficiency of the charac-
ters selected to distinguish the foregoing priinary groups into which spiders
have been divided, Ι venture to reconnnend the difference in the number of
eyes with which those animals are provided as the niost satisfactory basis of
their distribution into tribes3 supplying, as it does, well—defined characters
not difficnlt to be ascertained, and being in perfect harlnony with the leading
principle on which the subordinate groups are, for the most part, esta-
blished.

In the present lirnited state of our knowledge of the order ⁴·Iraneidea it

admits of a division into three tribes only.

l. OcToxoanlNA. Eyes eight.
2. δκΝυουωΝΛ. Eyes six.

3. BmoculeA. Eyes two.

The first tribe, Octmzoculina, is much the most extensive of the three, coin-
prising numerous genera, which present considerable differences in organiza-
tion and oeconoiny: closely connected with this gronp by intimate relations
of affinity and analogy, the second tribe, Senoczclina, includes seven or eight
genera, species belonging to most of which are indigenons to Great Britain: .
and the third tribe, Rinoculina, contains the single genus Nops, which has
been recently established by Mr. MacLeay for the reception of two remark-
able species of extra-European spiders†.

The newly-discovcred spiders described in the following pages are arranged
according to the inethod proposed above3 and it is a fact descrving of notice,
that they have been captured, without exception, in the north of England and
VVales.
