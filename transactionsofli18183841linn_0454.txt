378 Jlr. Hooo's Ob-serrations οη the Spongilla fluviatilis,

Professor Don, hy whose kind assistance Ι was enabled to see these bodies¹
magnified 400 times: even at such a high power we both were unable to
‹liscern the presence of any cilia, but most distinctly observed the entire
eovering or membrane of the sporules to be 1stu<lded all over with short pa-
pillae. Now it is very probable that the currents in the water, which Ι sup-
posed to have been caused by the rapid vibrations of tufts of cilia, were eur-
rents produced by a reciprocal action, or, to use the terius of M. Dutrochet‚
by an endosmosis and exosmosis, i. e. by an inward and an outward impul-
sion of fluids‚ not only through the membraues of these sporules, but also
through these membranaeeous papillae, in accordance with the discoveries of
that distinguished physiologist. therefore, the currents so produced would
Ι conceive be a satisfactory mode of accouuting for the singular and beautiful
phenomenon of locomotion as exhibited in these sporules; and it is in pur-
suance of the philosophical views of Mr. Berkeley, F.L.S.‚ as briefly mentioned
by him in a paper “ On the supposed Animal Nature of the Seeds of certain
³1!ng published at p. 233 of Hooker's Journal of Botany‚ part 3, for ,July
1834* ; although, if this hypothesis should ultimately not prove the correct one,
we must endeavour at another opportunity to investigate the causes of that
interesting phenomenon by a more minute and complete examination of the pa·
pillze with which those sporules are so abundantly furnished, and whilst they
are in a fresh state; for indeed I cannot but imagine that the function of loeo-
motion must bein part carried 011 by means of the currents which Ι noticed in the
water, proceeding from the spol-tiles, and very possibly effected in some degree
by a peculim, but as yet unknown, faculty of the papillae themselves.

Hence, from what has been said, it will be evident that loeomotion being
common both to some bodies pertaining to plants‚ and also to animals, the

ἢ( Ι think it better to insert here from that work Mr. Berkeley's own explanation of what he thinks
the real case to be 2 ‘⁴ XVhen the seed separates from the matrix, it passes into the water in which the
plant is immersed. Now if the contents of the seed, which are semifiuid, are of a different specific-
gravity from that of water, a mutual action of exosmose and endosmose will immediately take plac(¹
through the epidermis of the seed: the water will pass into the seed, and part of the fluid matter of
the seed will pass out into the water; and in consequence of this action, the current produced will
cause the seed to move about, until an equilibrium take place, when the seeds will settle at the bottom
and hegin to vegetate.’' See, for additional remarks on the same subject, p. 28 of Berkeley’s “ Glean-
ings of British Algae,'' Lond. 1833, where in plate x. the Ectosperma clavata is well represented.
