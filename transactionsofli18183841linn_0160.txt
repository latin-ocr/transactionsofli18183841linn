122 Mr. OoiLssv on certain Australian Quadrupeds,

from the contiguous islands of Tasinania and New Zealandsst, inhabited by
raees of human beings differing in language and origin from the nativos of
Continental Australia‚ appears almost to demonstrate his introduc-tion from
the north, where he is found in New Guinea, in Timor, in many of the sinaller
groups seattered throughout the Pacific Oeean, and in all the great islands of
the Indian Archipelago. The extirpation of the Tltgslaciuas Harrisii and
Drasysurm· [beaussa-0111 the eontinental portion of Australia‚ ir< a strong eor-
roboration of this suppositioni. It is contrary to all the principles of Zoolo-
gieal philosophy, and to what we already know os the laws whieh regulate the
geographica! distribution of anilnals, to suppose that these speeies, two of the
largest Mauunals in that part of the world, should have been originally eon-
tined to so small an island as Tasniania, to the exclusion of the neighbouring
continent. The inore probable theory is, that they were extirpated froin the
latter locality by the introduction of some inore powerful adversary: this
could have been no other than the native dog, to whose attacks these two
speeies were more peeuliarly exposed, froni being the slowest‚ most eowardly,
and least protected anilnals in thoeountry. The Uin-nbat, the Echidna, and
the Ornitlzorlegsnclzus are indeed 1nore sluggish, but theg are less obnoxious to
attaek on account. of their burrowing aud aquatic habits; the eonnnon Dasy-
ures, Kolus, and Phalangers find seeurity in their powers of elinibing trees:
and the Kangaroos and Potoroos in speed of soot> or by concealing themselves
in clinnps of inipenetrable brushwood. The 'l'lzjslacine and Ursino Das-yure
are in reality the only aboriginal inhabitants universally exposed to the attacks
of the dog3 and their total extirpation fron] the continental portion of Australia,
where he has been long established, and their confineinent to the eompara-
tively small island of Tasinania, to which he had never found his way before
the eolonization of the country, all hut demonstrate the reeentness of his intro-
duction into the neighbouring continent. Bm I shall not insist further upon
this question, though its bearings upon the history of the origin and migra-
tions of the aborigines of Australia are by no means devoid of iniportanee ι my
object is to describe two of the indigenous Rodents of that singular continent 3

* The dog is at present found in New Zerdand, but is believed to have been introduced by the early
navigators: in Van Diemen’s Land he was absolutely unknown previously to the settlement of the
British colonists at Hobart's Town.
