softens and expands by the action of water, but is not completely dissolved.
The larger bodies, the undoubted spondes, after a very slight inareration in
water—less than a minute is sufficient—arc enveloped hy a well-defined eover-
ing of gelatinous matter, which before the maccration existed in a concrete
state (Tm. xxxiv. fig. 3.). Further maceration does not appear to atl'eet this
gelatinous covering‚ as it remains unchanged long after gcnnination, and gives
to the sporule the appearance of having a very delicate transparent bordei·³
whose hreadth is about the fourth part of the diameter of the sporule. The
sporule consists of three coats, the outer of which is white, opitho, ¹*oniewhat
brittle, more or less incomplete at the conical extremity, but much thickcned
about the upper third of the sporule, where it exhibits traces of cellularity.
The middle coat is membraneus, clantio, of a light yellowish-lirown colom,
and perforated at the apex of the conical projection (ΤΑΒ. XXXIV. fig. 5.),
which is essentially formed by this coat, the outer coat being gradually lost
upon its Sin-face, or in some instances being scarcely continued on to it3 in
which case the Sporule appears truncated, the middle membrano not having
sufficient lirmness of itsclfto support the conical form (TARXXXIV. fig. 4815).
This conical projection is more or less plicatcd ; and in those instances in which
the outer coat is very deficient, thc middle membrane exhibits lines radiating
from the apel-ture. The third coat or internal membrane is similar in colour
to the middle, differing from it, however, in being inelastic and not being con-
tinued into the cone, hut forming a ¹Short cavity by passing directly across the
base of the cone, at which point it is not in contact with either of the other
membranes, and is marked by three lines, which radiate from the eentre of
the unsupportcd portion, and indicate a valvular structure to allow of the
protrusion of the growing matter in germination (TAB. XXXIV. fig. (5, 8, 9,
& l l.). [The eavity of the sporule is occupied by a quantity of grmnous fluid
and partit-les which are of various sizcs, the larger ones being mostly of an
ovoid Sinape, but altering by pressure (ΤΛΒ. XXXIV. fig. 6 & 7.).]

I found many of these sporules in a germinating state, the majority having
escaped from the involucrum„ but in several instances I found them eonsidew
ably advanced in germination before the rupture of the involucrum and whilst
they were yet inclosed in their sacs. The first external sign of gcrmination is

either the appearance of four cells projecting through the apex of the couieal
