with some Remarlrs on the Nature of the Spongiae Marinae. 381

Sponges. And Ι much suspect, that were these bodies belonging to several
more kinds of Spongia magnified 400 or 500 times, what have hitherto been
taken for cilia* will prove to be either papillae similar to those in the sporules
of the Spongilla fluviatilis, and that the supposed vibrations in the water are
in reality only endosmose and exosmose currents through the membranes of
these bodies and their papillae3 01· else, if when slightly magnified they appear
like the true cilia of animals, they will under a higher power of the micro-
scope be ascertained to be small tubules, as well through which, as through
the membranes of these germlike bodies, the same reciprocal action of fluids
takes place, and thereby most probably effects their remarkably similar move-
ments.

Moreover, since Ι have already attempted to describe the locomotive gerin-
like bodies of the River Sponge, and have alluded to those of the Sea Sponge,
the sporules of the club-shaped Ectosperma amongst plants, and the sponta-
neous 1110vements of the Globe Volvox among the Infusorians, it only relnains
to consider, for the sake of compari50n, the moving germs 01· gemmules of
some animal which strictly belongs to the Zoophytes. For this object, Ι will
select the loeoinotive gemmules of the Alcyonimn gelatinosmn (Linn.)†‚ as
they have been so recently discovered by Dr. A. Farre, and by whose kind-

ss Since Dr. Grant is evidently in error as to the tentacula of the Sertulariae being ciliated, (sce
Edinb. Phil. Journ. vol. xiii. p. 101) 1 cannot but think that he is under the like mistake respecting
cilia being also present upon the locomotive sporules of the Sea SpongeS. Both Dr. Johnston in his
Brit. Zooph., p. 43, and Mr. Lister in his memoir in the Phil. Trans. for 1834, p. 377, have subse-
quently ascertained that the Serfnlariae have no cilia. The family Sertalariadce belonging to 1ny
Unosculous subclass of Zooplzytes, Ι propose to arrange in an order called Noditentacula, from their
tentacles being furnished with nodi, small knots or projections. Such minute processeS‚ without the
aid of a very good microscope, and in a clear, strong, and equalized light, may very easily deceive the
eye of the observer. And I may remark, that my proposed order corresponds with a part of Dr.
Α. Farre's Polypi Nudib1·aclziati; but here it will be evident that this term is inapplicable to those
Zoophytes whose tentacula or brachia are rough with small knots or nodulos, and are furnished with
irregular hairlike projections according to the observations of M. Trembley on the Hydrae, andos
Mr. Lister on the Serczclariae.

† Itis the Halodactylus sliaphanus of Farre ; the Alcyonidium yelatinosum of Johnston (Brit. Zooph.) ;
the Ulva diaphana and Aleyonz'de‘um diaphanum of many botanists. It is singular that it should have
been so lately classed among plants. for its polypes were long ago mentioned in Solander and Ellis-'s
work on Zoophytes. See also the note of Mr. Gray in his paper on Sponges, at p. 50 of the Zoolm
gical Journal, vol. i.
