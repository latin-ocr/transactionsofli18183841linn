27. Vil il. Glumes membranous, unequal‚ not exceeding the paleae. Paleae
membranous, unarmed.

26. Agl-ostis. Glumes membranous, including. Paleae unequal, smooth, not
hardening upon the seed. Awn, if any, fine, dorsal.

29. Knapplu. Palea* seariose, shaggy, truncate, the inner minute or wanting.
Spieulae in a raceme, obscurely 2-1·owed. Rachis cylindrical.

24. Polgspngon. Glume furnished with a long slender seta! scariose, inclu-
ding. Paleae scariose; the outer with a dorsal awn.

25. Milium. Glumes herbaceo-seariose. Paleae membranc-coriaceous, nearly
equal, unarmed, hardening on the seed.

34). Piptatlzerwn. Glumes membranous. Floret sessile. Paleae subcoriaceous.
joined to a straight terminal awn, hardening on the seed.

31. Stipa. Glumes scariose, herbaceous at the base. Floret stalked. Paleze
eoflaceous, hardening on the seed, a geniculate and twisted dorsal awn
joined to its extremity.

32. Aclznatlzeram. Glumes seariosc, herbaeeous at the base. Paleae mem-
branons. Awn geniculate and twisted‚ with a distinet though slightly

marked joining on to the outer palea, at which it readily breaks off.

L. Spiculae in a loose pauide, with a second imperfect floret.

49. Halous. Lower floret perfect, unarmed. Upper generally barren, awned.

ffi. Arrlzenatlzerum. Lower floret barren, with a geniculate awn3 upper per

16. Hieroclzloe. Two outer florets barren; middle perfect, diandrous, all

Meli ca uniflora.

M. Spiculae scattered, with more than one perfect floret.

NB. In these genera, Aira, Deschampsia, Dantlmnia, and :leena are mostly
awned, the awn easily breaking away from the palea. They are never suin
nished with a seta forming a mere continuation of the midrib. In Triselum
and Koeleria it is rather diffie-ult to decide whether we find an awn or a seta.
