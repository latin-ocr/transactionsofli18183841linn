426 Prqf. LINDLEY οη the Anatomy qstlze Roots (ᾖ Ophrydeae.

The roots of all the other Oplnydeoe‚ whether European or not, which I
have had the opportunity of examining, are consti-uctred essentially in the same
manner as that of Satyrizmz pallidum. The differences Ι find among them
consist chiefly in the size and shape of the nodules, and in the proportion they
bear to the surrounding parenchyma; in the quantity of starch formed in the
latter3 and in the way in which sections of the tubercles are affected by expo-
sure to the air. In Orclzis maculata, for instance, there is more starch than
usual, the nodules when fresh are not much largcr than the cells of surround-
ing parenchyma, and the Section of the root remains white, while in Satyriwn
pallidum it becomes deep brown. Beyond this Ι have observed nothing which
deservcs notice.

But while the presence of nodules is so universal in this tribe of Orchi-
daccw, it is not a little singular that they should be as generally absent in
the tubereles of the other tribes of the same natural order. Up to the present
time l have not sueceeded in detecting them in any species of Neottieoe or
eli-etlzuscw, of which I possess roots. In the tubex-cles of New Holland Orchi-
daceoe the cells appear to be exclusively occupied by starch, with which they
are in fact filled3 at least, such is the case in Glossffllia minor, Thelymitra
carnea, and another species, Caladenia testacea, Cmywntlzes hiemem-ata, and
many species of Dim-is and Pterostylis.

Ι have already stated that the nodules appear to be homogencous. But the
slowness with which their horny eontents are acted upon by the alcoholic so-
lution of iodine³ and the frequent arrangement of the secretions of plants in a
stratified manner in the lignified parts of vegetation, led me to suspect that
this homogeneity was only apparent. Nevertheless‚ for a long time Ι sought
in vain for evidence of their contents being organized3 in whatever way they
were cut, whatever reagents were employed, sections of the nodules presented
the same unvarying uniform surface. At last, upon examining some Coc-ent
Gai-den Salep‚-a coarse preparation of wild Oplnydeoe,—-tliin slices of which
Ι had made with a knife whose edge had lost its keenness, and which therefore
bruised the Salep while cutting it, an indistinct granular appearance became
visible upon some of the divided nodules, not however so well defined as to
enable me to judge of its real nature. But upon chari-ing the slices by
Mr. Reades' process, a beautiful definition of the granulation was obtained.
