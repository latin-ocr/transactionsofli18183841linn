2. SEGUIERIA.

The circumstance of a polyandrous genus amongst the true llsonoclzlamysleoe
is of so rare occurrence, that the first impression conveyed by an unknown
plant of that description is that of a defective polypetalous one; and accord-
ingly, although some species or other of Segut'eria occurs in most extensive
south American collections, I have usually found it amongst Swartziese or
with Secta-idaea, to both of which the genus bears some external resemblance.
For this reason, probably, not only no new species has yet been described since
Jacquin and Linnzeus published the original S. amm-imma, but even ot' that
plant no description has appeared but what has been taken from one of those.
two authors. The affinities of the genus were entirely unknown, until Brown,
who had examined three Brazilian species, associated it (App. to Tuckey,
p. 36.) with Petiveria as a tribe of Plzqzstolacew.

The peculiarities of this tribe are there alluded to in the following words:
‘⁶ The lateral stigma, the spiral cotyledons, and want of albumen in I’etireria.
remove it to Some distance from the other genera of I'lzgstolaceoe‚ and at the
same time connect it with Seguieria, with which also it agrees in the alliaceous
odour of the whole plant.'' The laterai stigma and solitar-y carpel is very
remarkable in all species of Seguieria; in the seeds I emnnined, which were
unripe, Ι found a considerable quantity of nlucilage resembling albumen, and
a small, somewhat curved embryo‚ with cotyledons by no means spiral, giving
me the idea that they were very similar to the seeds of several true Plzgstolacece ;
it is only when they arrive at inaturity, in which state Mr. Brown examined
them, that their true structure may be seen. Although my specimens are
insufficient in this respect, yet the genus is so little known, and so remark-
able in other points, that I have added to the following synopsis of the species
known to me, a figure of one, in which the fruit, though immature, has attained
