1116 66115 or pores of the Sponge. This opinion 15, Ι think, worthy of addi-
tional invesfigaffion, because to the exterior of the shells of the seedlike bodies
certain fibi-es or tubules are often appended.

In pursuing the same inquiry, the following is another supposition which
has occurred to 1ne; that the seedlike bodies are the sporidia, and the gerni-
like bodies the sporules of the River Sponge, because Ι found that 011 opening
the seedlike bodies the soft white opake substance with which they are filled,
when spread out and 5111111111161] 10 11 great power of the microscope, consists
of numerous granules interspersed among a somewhat transparent jellyss.
These granules arc round or egg-shaped‚ exceedingly minute, and quite dia-
phanous, except as 10 11 51101, which is evidently a particle of the same jelly.
And as the seedlike bodies themselves are lixed within the cells of the Sponge,
they ought strictly to be considered as the seed-vessels or sporidia, and the
granules contained within them as the seeds or sporules. Also, since the
sporidia when apparently full grown have an orifice at their upper extremity
whereby the gelatinous substance and granules escape, the latter, if identical
with the germlike bodies, pursuing 111611· way through the water that fills the
passages or canals formed by the fibrous network of the Sponge, emerge and
swim or glide about by means of their locomotive power, until they have at-
tained sufficient lnaturity‚ and have procurcd for themselves a safe lodge-
1nent; they then begin to germinate and vegetate by degi-ees. Howevcr, Ι
116611 scarcely observe to you, that further experiments are necessary to deter-
mine which of these two suppositions 15 1116 11116 006, that is to say, whether
the locomotive germlike bodies ultimately become identical with the fixed
seedlike bodies, or whether the former are the real sporules, and the 1111161·
1116 51)011(1111; yet I may add, ‘that I am most strongly inclined to the latter.

Again, having before remarkcd that the only traces from whence Ι 6011111
111 all infer the animal nature of the River Sponge were its locomotive spo-

decaying or breaking of parts of the Sponge itself; or by many other causes. They then, attaching
themselves to whatever suitable substance they may happen to fall upon, quickly germinate.

* Professor Link has observed the 511016 sort of substance and granules (seminules) in the similar
seedlike bodies (sporanges) of the Sponqilla lacustri& He has described them thus: “Lorsqu'on
ecrase ces conceptacles de graines 61 qu'on les regarde avec un grossissement tres fort, on voit les
5601100165 plonge'es dans une masse qui est molle tant qu'elle est fraiche.'' (Annales des Sciences Natu-
relles, seconde serie, tom. ii. p. 328.)
