totally wanting: but Ι have already stated in iny observatiomv on that tribe
the reasons which inrluce nie to place it here. The want ot' any truce ot' au
exterior 1·u(li111ent,as well as the inore delicate texture of the paleae, keep thein
away t'roin the Pana-ew and Plialaritlew, and they have not those long sillx’y
hairs which distinguish the Arzm‹lin‹1‹·‹¹w. The last character is, I inust con-
fess, the least satisfactm-y, sor solue speeies of lsslgrostis have soft hairs and
not very short ones, so that without the sinaller size and inore delicate tex-
ture of the plant one might he at a loss in which tribe to place it.

Genera:

1. Pnhspogan. Gluines scarioseq furnished with a long seta'. Paleae nearly
equal⁷ filmy, included. Awn dorsal, or none.

2. Milium. Glunies lierbaeeo-scariose, hardly exceeding the inenihrano-eo-
riaceouz= paleae. Palea* nearly equal, uum-nied, liai·‹lening on the seed}

23. Agros-lia·¹ Gluines nienilnalmus, acute. l'aleae ΙκἰιωωῐΙι, scm-lose, unequal
in length, the inner sometimes wanting, 'l'he awn, if any, is dorsal.

4. [Usa. Glunies unequal, falling short ot' the paleae, both ineinbranons
Palvae nearly cquah unarinffll.

;3. (3'0leantlms. Gluines υς tloweffi solitary2 palea* unequal; the outer with
a rough keel, terininating in a short seta. Stainens ⁴23

6. Knnppia. Intlorescence in a raeenie, soniewhat one->idest Spiculae trun-
cate. Paleoe included, scariose or filiny, sfflggy, the inner minute or

wanting.

The awn is wanting in P‹›(1JJJ‹›g‹»1 maritimnm3 where it occurs it is easily
separahle froin the corolla⁷ and is therefore a true awn. The long terniinal
seta of the glunic in this genus is very remarkable, separating it at once froin
almost all others. Sinith and Hooker describe it as strictly terminal. To
ine it scenis to be placed a little below the extr-cinity.

MlLlun. M. effluxum. is the only European speeies left by Kunth in tbi>
genus, and lle places it among the Pana-ew, considering the part which has
the appearance of an inner glunic, and which is quite similar in forn} and tex-
ture to the outer glunic, as a neutral floret. There is nothing in the structure
or disposition of the parts to countenance such an hypothesis, and Ι therefore

consider it as belonging to the Agrostldeoe. V1LFA of Link offers only one
