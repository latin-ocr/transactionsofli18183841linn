but at last, they contain a little grumous matter. that becomes of the mother-
ecll Ι arn unable to say: Ι am inclined to think that a portion of it becomes
attached to the surface of each of the sporules, of which there are about forty
in each sac.

The other bodies, or rather those which occupy the sacs at the lower part
of the involuerum,-for there is no differenee between the two at the earliest
stage, except in position,-should have been described first, on account of their
being somcwhat more advanced in point of development; but as the changes
are rather more complex thau those just described, I prefer taking them in
this order. The sporules (ΓΑΒ. XXXV. fig. 31 ἃ 32.) first eularge, become
pellucid, and recede from each other just as the last-described (TAB.XXXV.
fig. 33), but they do not appear to remain long in this stage, as it is very dif-
ficult to obtain them until nearly all the sporules have been ruptured from
some unknown cause (TAB. XXXV. fig. 38). The shrivelled remains of the
ruptured sporules continue to he attached to each other by their stalks, and
the mother-cell remains perfect; in short, no further change takes place, for
they may be found in this state in the same sac with the ripe sporules
(Tm. XXXV. fig. -12,‹1.). The two or three unruptured sporules, which are
single in each union, the other three being invariably ruptured (ΤΑΒ. XXXV.
sig. 37), enlarge, each struggling for the mastery, and it is not long before
one prevails, the smallcr ones ruptnring and passing into the same state as
those first ruptured (Tm. XXXV. fig. 3⁴5). The sole remaining sporule now
cnlarges rapidly, assumes a pyriform shape, and the mother-cell gradually
recedes from it by a still more rapid enlargement, except around the narrow
extremity to which the three ruptnred sporules which form the union are
attached, where the mother-cell has contracted an adhesion. It appears that
this dilatation of the mother-cell is caused by a seeretion of fluid between it
and the sporule, for if the cell be punctured the fluid will escape, and the cell
return by its clasticity to the same dimensions as the sporule. The three rup-
tured spomles, which up to this period remained attached to the growing
sporule, now disappear, and, as Ι have not been able to make an exact obser-
vation as to the manner of their disappearanee, I cannot say positively whether
they have been absorbcd or discharged through a rupture of the mother-cell.

That this last supposition is the correct one, I think may be iuferred from the
