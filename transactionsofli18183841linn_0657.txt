(ι Gra-ss (gftlw Tribe of Bambuseae, δίο. 559

twenty miles we observed a large chain of mountains, which trended NNE.
and S.s.xv.; and among this chain a high mountain was pointed out to us,
which they called Mashiatti, and where we were told that these reeds were
growing3 but as we were given to understand that we should fmd them like-
wise at Marawacca, and as Mashiatti was entirely out of our road, we did not
visit it. It was consequently only in the middle of February, and after we had
crossed the river Parima, that my wish of becoming acquainted with that
curious plant was accomplished.

The Maiongcong and Guinau Indkms, whom the Spaniards eall Maquiri-
tares, conducted us to that part of Marawaeea (a high mountain which ter-
minates in an almost perpendicular wall of sandstone) where the plant grows.
It is a day's journey from a Maiongcong settlement on the river Cuyaca, from
whence the hospitable aud good-natured savages showed us the beaten track.
After having aseended Mount Marawacca, to about 3500 feet above the Indian
village, the traveller follows a small mountain-stream, on the banks of which
the Caras or Clo-atas, as the Indians call these reeds, grow in dense. tufts.
They form generally clusters of from fifty to one hundred, which are pushed
forth, as in many other species of that tribe, by a strong,jointed‚ subterraneam
rootstock. The stem rises straight from the rhizoma, without a knot, and
of equal thickness, frequently to a height of sixteen feet, where the first disse-
piment stretehes across the inside, and the first branchlets are formed. The
articulations then continue at regular intervals of about fifteen or eighteen
inches to a further height of from forty to fifty feet. The full-grown stem is at
the base an inch and a half in diameter, or nearly five inches in circumference.
lt is of a bright green, perfeetly smooth, and hollow inside. The branchlets
surround the culm at the nodes in small bundles, and are arranged in a verticil-
late manner; they are generally from three to four feet in length, very slender,
terete, and nodose ; the upper articulations two to three inches apart, and longer
than the first, vaginated; the vagina split at the apex, persistent, striated, some-
what scabrous. The leaves are alternate, linear-lanceolate, of a bright green
above, glaucescent below, nervose, striated, the midrib prominent, marginated,
margin scabrous, acute3 from eight to nine inches long, and five and a half to
six lines broad, obliquely rounded at the base; provided with a short petiole,
which is articulated to the vagina; ligulated ; ligula very short and pilose,
