and axillam-y, solitary, or sometimes 2 together, one of which is nearly
sessile. Fruit triangular, covered by the subagglutinated calyx, its faces
elliptical‚ pointed, granulated and opake.

Nearly related to P. humile, Meisn. (microceplmlmn, Don), but differs froin
it by having only one nearly simple steni froin a fibrous root3 the flowers
8-androus, the fruit 3-angular, the leaves glabrous, and the bracteae glaudular.
It agrees with Rpetsbratum, Don, in all respectS, except by not having glands
at the base of its stipules.
