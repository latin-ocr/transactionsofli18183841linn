facts, that the other ruptured sporules are not absorhed‚ and that an aperturc
in the mother-cell does actually exist at the proper place, hut on account of
the delicacy of the object it cannot be clearly aseertaiued until a later period
(Tim. XXXIV. fig. 5.). The spornlc now begins to assume a vellowish--brown
hue, and a deposition of opake matter takes place on the outer snrface of the
mother-cell around the smaller extremity (TAB. XXXV. fig. 40 ἃ 41.). This
deposition gradually increases until the whole sporule is completely covered,
except in some occasional instances the apex of the conical projection formed
by the mother-cell remains nncovered (ΤΛΒ. XXXIV. fig. 4 ἃ 5.). This depo-
sirion, which forms the outer coat of the spol-ule, is much thicker about the
smaller extremity of the spornle than elsewhere, and acquires at this part
a fibro-cellular texture, as represented at TAB. XXXIV. fig. (j. 'When the
outcr coat is completely formed, the mother-cell οι· middle coat censes to
enlarge, whilst the inncr sac or true sporule continues its growth until it is
eheeked by coming· in coutact with the iunci· surface of the mother-cell, to
which in its mature state it. is firmly adherent. The sporule isat first perfectly
pellucid and deficient of all granular coutents; it is not till after the addition
of the outcr coat that the grumous granular matter is secreted. It will he
seen from this description, that the anatomy of the ripe sporule aecor-ds with
what is ohserved to take place during· its developmcnt3 aud as thc dissection
of the ripe spor-ule occurred first in the order of my ohservations, this eorre-
spmnhffnce was a source of great satisfaction to me. It appears, therefore, to
he certain that the spornle consists‚ in the first place, of the. interna] membrane
or coat l'ormed by the true sporule, then the middle coat formed hy the
mother-cell, and lastly‚ the onter testaceous opake coat, the result of the ‹le-
position, to which some. may perhaps be inclined to add the gelatinous cover-
ing which makes its appearance ou maceration in water3 hut as it is not an
organized substance, I am not disposed to consider it as a proper integnment.
As there is no evidence whatever, during the development of the sporule, ot'
the internal delicate sae which is found after germination has commcnccd, Ι
think we may safely conclude that it is the product of germination. It is
scarcely necessary to remark, that the first-described bodies are those which
have been considered by some botanists as the pollen, or that Dr. Lindley's
shrewd conjecture, that they are abortive sporules, is perfectly correct. In
