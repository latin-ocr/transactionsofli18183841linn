Mr. VVoons οη the Genera ‘ff Enrepean Grasses. 39

The spiculae of AveNA are said to be 3 or mere fiewered, but we cannot
depend on this character, since A. sativa and A. orientalis have. only 2 ;
and this is sometimes the case with A.fatua, A. lzirtula, A. amethystina,
A. brevis, and A. alba, among the Grasses ef Europe: we must, therefore,
chiefly rely upon the furrewed and crested seed to distinguish it from Afra as
well as from Trisetum. The awn is said to be from the base of the palea in
Aira, and from the back in Arena, and the former lias a shining panicle‚ but
there are exceptions both ways to each of these circumstances.

GAUDINIA is readily distinguished by its spiked florets and unequal glumes,
and Ι think there is no danger of its being referred te any other tribe. The
geniculate dorsa! awn is net to be found among the Hordeaceoe er Rottboelli-
acere.

ARRHENATHERUM and HOLCUS are sufficiently marked by the characters
above given. The habit of the plant obliges me to place here the first of these
genera in spite of the outer imperfect floret. It cannot be confounded with
any of the Pana-ece or Phalaridew. The membraneus and strongly-ribbed
paleae and geniculate dorsa] awn keep it quite distinct from these. families.
DANTHONJA decumbens has been considered as a Poa and as a Festus«, and it
might seem, therefore, probably to belong te the Festucacm, but Ι think
Kunth has done well in placing it here. I am in this principally guided by
the large membraneus glumes, and by its close affinity to D. μνουὶη(ιάίῐκθ
from which it differs almost in nothing but in the want of the twisted upper
part of the awn. without prctending to decide whether T›·i0dia‚ ef which Ι
know nothing, be really a distinct genus, Ι cannot agree with those who would
separate these two species.

FEsTUCACEAE.

This is on the whole a very distinct tribe, although closely allied by some
of its genera to the Acenacea» on the one hand, and to the Hordeacew on the
ether. The spiculae are scattered, many-flowered. The glumes are unequal,
shorter than the spicula, generally thinner than the outer palea, never ef a
thicker Ol· firmer substance. The outer palea is usually mere or less distinctly
nerved er ribbed, herbaceeus or membraneus, not coriaceeus while the plant
is in flower, but in some species hardening on the seed; while in others the
inner becomes attached to the seed without alteration. They generally have
