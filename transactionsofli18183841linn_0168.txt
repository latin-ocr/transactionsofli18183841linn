This little animal is rather larger than a common mouse, which it is de-
scribed as closely resembling in the eolour aud texture of the fur, being of
the same pale ashy-brown tinge on the upper and outer parts, and elearer or
more greyish ash beneath. The head 15 thick and short3 the muzzle blunt;
the upperjaw projeeting considerably beyond the lower, and copiously fur-
nished with an abundanee of long blaek inonstaches; the eyes are of mode-
rate size; and the ears rather large, ercet, rounded at the points, and appa-
rently naked. The fore feet are short, the hind excessively long, as 111 1116
rest of the genus, the disparity being equally due to the development both of
the tibia and tarsus; the arms, legs, and thighs arc covered with fine soft fur,
like the rest of the body, but the tarsus and paws are nearly naked, or only
covered with very short, adpressecl silvery hairs. The tail is considerably
longer than the body, naked and scaly towards the origin, but covered, on
the terminal half, with long black hairs of a silky quality, which gradually
increase in number, and form a middling sized brush at the tip.

The dimensions of this animal, as taken from a figure as large as life, are
as follows.
