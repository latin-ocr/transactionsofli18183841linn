316 Per. DON's Descriptions qf the Indiam. Species of Iris0

these specimens, as well as of many others sent by Pallas, and which had
reached the great Swedish Naturalist towards the close of his earthly career,
we find no mention in any of his works; and it appears from the papers on
which they are pasted‚ that even the charge of placing them into the Herba—
rinm had been committed to his son.

The chief points of difference between this species and biglumz‘s are its
lengthened peduncles and narrower sepals: for in other respects they are so
much alike. that, without a very careful examination‚ the specimens might
readily be confounded.

My knowledge of the colour of the flowers of this and the preceding species
is derived from a series of very beautiful drawings in the possession of Dr„
Royle.
