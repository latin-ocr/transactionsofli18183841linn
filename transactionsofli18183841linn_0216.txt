The habit of this singular genus recalls to mind the Lepidmlemlra, those
forms which at present exist only in a fossil state, the axis is stndded with
the persistent adherent. bases of the. leaves, resembling the lozenge-shaped
marks on the stem of the fossil genus above·mentioned, and the ramification
frequently presents a dichotomous appearance, which arises from the nonde-
velopmcnt of one of the latcral branchos, the normal arrangement being a
primary axis with two opposite lateral branchos. The bases of the leaves of
Lsscopmliacece being so completely continnons with the axis would not pre-
¹sent such marks as those mentioned, and I am therefore inclined to consider
Lepidudemlron as allied rather to (bufferw than to that family, and the in-
teresting genus above described appears to present us with an evidcnt link of
connexion. I have not had an opportunity of examining the internal struc-
ture of Lepidmlemlmm, but it is a subject well descrving investigation to
ascertain whether the vessels composing its woody tissue present that uni-
formity and dotting which prevail throughout Cong’ferw.

The female spike in Arsa-ota.2›i.s, nnlilzc that of most ofthe other genera of Cu-
pressinew, forms a regular strobilus as in Pinus, and the scales are very thick,
woody and persistent, as in the normal gronp of that. genus. I have assumed
that they are composed of a braete and periearpinm, which are here completely
