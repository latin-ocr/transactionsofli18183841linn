eyes of the trapezoid are much the largest, and the anterior ones, which
are placed on an eminence, the sinallest of the eight. Mandibles power-
ful, conical, aruied with two rows of tecth on the. inner sui-face, and in-
clined towards the. sternum, which is heart-shaped‚ glossy‚ and thinly
covered with long, ercet hairs. Maxillae strong, straight, and soinewhat
quadrate. Lip semicircular and prominent at the extremity. The nian-
‹libles and maxilla* are brown, with a faint. tinge of red, and the sternuin
and lip browuish black, the latter being dark brown at the tip. Legs
and palpi long, and ofa yellowish brown colour‚ with brownish hlack
hands. First pair of legs the longest, then the second, third pair the
shortest. Eaeh tarsus in this, as in the other speeies of Linyphia, is ter-
minated by three claws: the two superior ones enrved and pectinated‚
und the inferior one inflected near its insertion. The. palpi have at their
extremity a long, slightly cui-ved claw, minutely (lentated inore than half
its length froin the base. Abdonien thinly covered with hairs, very con-
vex aliove, projecting over the base of the cephalo-thorax: it is of a yel-
lowish hrown colour‚ freckled with small, whitish spots, which are fewer
in number and inore minute on the. under side: on the anterior part of
the uppcr side are large, brownish black blotches‚ and on the posterior
part numerous transverse⁷ eurved lines of the same hue, whose convexities
are directed sorwards3 the sides ure brownish black, with an irregular,
longitudinal hand ot* yellowish brown, spotted with white, extending
along the middle. The spinners are br0wn, and at the base of the
inferior pair are three confluent, yellow spots, forming a rhomboid. A
small, cylindrical, seinitransparent process is connected with the anterior
part of the sexual organs, within the external orifice. Plates of the spi-
racles pale yellow.

The uiale hears a strong resemblance to the female, but is rather
smaller and dai-ker coloured than she is; the anterior part of the cephalo-
thorax alsoj on which the eyes are seated, is inore elevated. The relative
length of the legs is the sanie in both sexes, but their absolute length is
greater in the male, an anterior one measuring {ffths of an incli. Third

and fourth joints of the palpi short, the fornici· having a long bristle pro-
