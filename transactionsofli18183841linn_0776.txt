Meisner ³³, aud lastly Endlicher†, have all, with much doubt it is true,
placed them near Amantiaceoe, whilst Lindleyss inserts them, with equal
hesitation, among his Pittospot·s1les§.

The genera usually considered as truc Olacineoe, are 01101, Linn., (including
Spermaizysrum, Labill., and F issilia, Conuners.,) Heisteria, Linn.‚ Ximenia‚Linn.,
Gomphensis-11,VVall„ and, as 3301331035 forms, opilia, Roxb., (including Groutia,
Guille1n.‚) and Jcacina, Adr. Juss. To these I propose 10 add, besides Apody-
les, E. Meyer, Sehomburgk's new genus, which Ι 113νο 0311011 Pogopetalum, and
Lei-etia, Vellozo, now first described, also ›S'clzoelfia, Solu-eb„ and Cmnjeru,
Lam. Ι 110 1101 advert. to the genera of Du Petit Thouars and Blume, usually
enumerated at the 01111 of 0130111010, 1101· to chilesia of Manuel Blanco, because,
until they shall have been more completely or more accurately described, their
111-11311105 can only be guesscd at; and Balanites has long since been rejected
by Jussieu, though still oceasionally added to Olacinew, for no other reason
that I 0311 1101001νο but from its having once been considered as a species of
⁴Yimem'a.

The above-named genera consist chiefly oftrees or shrubs, oecasionally 01111111-
ing, unarmed, or in Ximenia and some 51100105 of Olaa, bearing axillary 51111105.
The leaves are alternate, exstipulate, simple and entire, neither glandular nor
dotted. The inflorescence is terminal only in 1011011111 31111 Αμοτζιχίεκ, where it
is eorymbose: in all the other genera it is axillary; glomerate in IIei.steria;
