ture between the 2nd and 3rd towards the base, a Qnd before the middle,

and a 3rd towards the apex, which is slightly emarginatc.
In one specimen the elytra have a slight dull green tinge: it is considerahly
like what I take to be the H. tardus, Ill.. and was found at Port St. Elcna

and Conception.

The 2nd and 3rd joints of the antennae are sometimes picenus, and all the
others pale ferruginous. It was abundant at (joi-rite and at Maldonado in

November. Lieut. Graves.

Oehreus; oculis, capite, clypeo excepto, scutelle subtusque nigris3 thorace
angust03 elytris longissimis, nigro-lineatis reticulatisquc.
Length 41ss, breadth 2 lines.

Ochi-eous, shining: head and eyes biauk-2 leaving a semiorbicular ochi-eous
space on the clypeus: {hm-mv short, a little broader than the head, trans-
verse-oblong, a line of puneturcs before and behind near to the margins,
a short channel on the dise, sides a little depressed: scale! piceons. Ely-
tra nearly twice as broad as the thorax at the base, and seven times as
long, elliptical, apex truncated a little obliquely; some scattered punc-
tures in lines, a short black streak on each side of the scutellum, 3 long
ones down the disc, and 2 or 3 oblique ones on the sides; the spaees
between somewhat reticulated with blaek, leaving a broad marginal space

free: underside piceous.

A male from Port St. Elena. The narrow thorax and very long elytra de-
part so far from the typical form of Colymbetes, that I have little doubt of this
being a good genus; but as Ι have 110 specimen to dissect Ι have not ventured

to establish it as such.
