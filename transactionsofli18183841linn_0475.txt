those of the Ectosperma; from its germination and subsequeut manner of
growth being precisely similar to those exhibited by many of the lower
plants; fron] the general resemblance of its trausparent membraue or euticie
to that of the leaves of plants; from its jelly or parenehymatous substance
being composed of globules; from the chromule contained in them giving a
permanent colour to paper3 from the effects of aeids upon its whole sub-
stance, and green colour; from its total want of irritability and sensation;
from its not being polypiferous3 from possessing no trace of any animal or-
ganizati0n3 and froin its receiving nutriment from the water amnes-have ren-
dered me no longer doubtful.

In conclusion, you will permit mc to add a few general remarks 011 the
nature of the Spongia? stlat-ime, avoiding at the same time as much repetition
of my preceding observations as the. subject itself will allow.

Considering that these remarkable substances‚ which have so long puzzled
authors in their endeavours to assigu to them a proper station in the classi-
fication of the various works or productions of nature⁷ were composed of a
fibrous unorganized skeleton, generally streugtliened by spicula, aud formed
by secretion from a soft parenehymatous substance or jelly, which in fact
constituted the individual ani1na13 that this animal-jelly was endowed, ac-
cording to several naturalists, with some slight symptoms of sensation and of
contr-action and dilatatiou‚ and possessed the powers of suc-king in and throw-
ing out the sea-water by a sort of inspiration and expirati011, I therefore in-
stituted sor them an order, which Ι tei-med Gelatini 'et-111²*7 in purpose to
express this view of the animal or live jelly. For in the summers of 1822 and
1823 'many observations on some specimens of &magia oculata and S. urens,
in their native localities on the coast of Dur-hain, convinced me that they
were in truth not polypiferous; but I was then unable to prove with any
satisfaction to myself the contr-actile and expansive faculties, which I was

'⁸‘ Dr. Grant has lately placed the Sponges in an order Porzfera. But I must here observe, that in
my ‘¹ Natural History of the Vicinity of Stockton on Tees,'’ which was written in the spring of 1325,
printed in 1826, and published in 1827, Ι formed my 4th order of Polyparia ¹‘ Pei-{fer(1‚'' to com-
prise the genera Cellepora, lilillepora, and Tabaliporu. And I have in a former note stated that my
order 8. Gelatinifera compreheuds the Sponges.
