Cephalo-thorax oval, glossy‚ gibbous above, with slight furrows on the sides,

and a minute indentation in the medial line of the posterior region. Man-
dibles conieal, armed with teeth 011 the inner surface, and inclined towards
the sternam, which is broad, convex and heart-shaped. These parts, with
the lip, are brownish blaek. Maxillae reddish brown. Legs red-brown,

placed 011 the sides of the anterior segmeut. The fourth joint of the palpi
is larger than the third, and consists of three parts; one in front, which
is broad, and round at the extremity; a smaller one underneath, of a
similar form: and a long, slender one on the inner side, which passes
obliquely before the fifth joint: fifth joint somewhat oval, having a pro-
