quite as long as those in A. Halleri or A. ινιιχῖυαΐῐοα. The sizc and coarseness
of the plant common to the tribe forms certainly part of our notion of the
Arwulinacew, but A. tenella seems intermediate. both in this circumstance and
in the hairs which envelop its flor-ets, and it is placed by some botanists in
the genus Agr-ostis. On the other hand, some of the many-tlowercd specics
seem technieally to approach to Arctum but the hairs of the latter genus are
usually stiffer, and not so fine and silky as in Arunda. The awn too⁷ when it
occurs, is always strongcr among the Avenacew, and twisted as well as geui-
culate. lf Descl1ampsia cuns-pitosa be rightly separated from Ait-11, its size and
coarse perennial herbage‚ as well as the hairs at the base of the floret, might
almost justify us in placing it among the Arundinacew.

In forming the genera of this tribe, the number of florets in a spicula seems
hardly to afford a sullieient ground. The ‹liss‘erence of habit between the two
extremes is not great, and the gradation is complete from the strictly single-
fiowcred spieulae of ('alam‹1gr0sti.s·‚ to those containing also an abortire rudi-
ment in I)ey‹1u„ria‚ and thence through A. Plinii, in which they have sometimes
only a rudiment, and sometimes a complete second floret (when it becomes
the Aranda Itg'flora of the Florentine botanists)‚ and A. ›itaut-ilaniea (which is·
perhaps the same speeies‚ but is described as having from one to three florcts)
to A. Duum, where the tlorcts vary from two to five. The gradation os habit is
as complete as that of the number of fiorets. Phragmites loves a more watery
situation than the others, and the barren or ncutral lower floret. atl'ords us a
good and stable generic character; but if Ι were to separate the many-
flowered species, Ι should be ‹lisposed to unite s'alamagrostis and Degseumia
under the name of Arunda, as was done by Mertens and Koch, and to assign
to the remaining plants the generic name of Donate. The genera I am willing

to aelmowledge are :

l. Arunda. Spiculoe 1- or more-flowered, the lowcrmost perfect. Glumcs
equal, or the outer the largest. These and the paleae membraneus. Pa-
nicle diffuse. seed hairless.

2. Ammopleila. Spiculae l-flowered, with an interior rudiment. Glumes nearly
equal‚ membrano-scariose. Paleae membranous, nei-ved, with a short,
straight, nearly terminal awn. Panicle spike-lilzel
