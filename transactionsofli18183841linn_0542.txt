458 Jlr. E. J. QUEKETT on the Ergot (gf Rye,

vicwed as a transparent object with a low magnifying power, exhibits a gra-
nular eentre surrounded by a purplish border: the longitudinal seetion shows
the same granular appearance along its middle part, bounded also on either
side by the purple border. There is now something deceptive about these
objects if immet-sed in water, there being then observed issuing from them
inpiatis of minute particles resembling sporidia, which completely fill the field
of view. These however are not sporidia, but particles of an oily nature,
together with certain other granules the cells contain (analogous to those
found in the healthy grain with the fecula), which now float out from the di-
vided cells, and may be readily taken, as they were by philippam for sporidia,
if the magnit'ying power be not sufficiently distinct and powerful.

As the ergot approaehes maturity its colour becomes dark purple ᾗ, and its
surfaee generally presents many cracks and fissures: its shape at this time is
subject to much variatim), being generally elongated and tapering away at
, each end, sometimes occurring quite straight, at others slightly 01· very much
curved, there being besides these many other forms of length and thickness
constantly observed; its section transversely is more or less triangular, and
presents a furrow on one or both sides, especially in the rye, though these are
not discoverable in the ergots of all grasses.

then the ergot has arrived at its perfect development, it still retains in
those spec-iniens that have not been exposed to injury the appendage at its
apex, a few hairs surrounding the remains of the stigmas‚ and likewise the
two scales at its base, which appear but very little changed, and its surface
has now become almost deprived of sporidia.

lt appears from the examination of the healthy grains of rye that the ergot
corresponds to the seed without its pericarpial covering3 for it is found that
the grain of the rye has two distinct layers for its periearp, the outcr being
very thin and composed of elongated cells, whose longer axis is perpendicular‚
and the inner of elongated cells also, hut the longer axis is horizontal: within
these two layers is a line of some witlth, which is coloured of a reddish brown
tint and connected by its inner side to a layer of cells, which have somewhat

⁵ In several instances ergots have been found not of a violet black eolour, hut os different lighter
simules, and even of the colour of the healthy grain.
