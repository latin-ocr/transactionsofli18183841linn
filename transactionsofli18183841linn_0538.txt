454 Mr. E. J. QUEKETT on the Ergot QfRye,

removed, the ohservations published hy some of the later authorities have gone
far towards our viewing this production in a clearer light, especially those of
Leveille, Philippar, and Phoebus, from whom we learn much interesting matter,
and also thc history and former hypotheses respecting the Ergot, which here
will be omitted, for the sake of brevity.

On examining* the spikes of the infected grasses whilst recent, there could
be observed lodged between the paleae of the flowers (bearing ergots) a quan-
tity of a viscid fluid⁷ which appears to exude from them ; and on others could
be seen an appearance as if something slimy had once been smeared over them.
On submitting the fluid to the microscope, it was found to bc composed of an
infinite number of particles‚ mixed with some liquid, and whose number alone
appeared to cause its viscidsty, the taste and smell it afforded being of a faintly
sweet character, even when examined in minute quantitics.

On examining the slimy appearanoes, which are of a darkish colour‚ that
occur on certain paleae of Elymus, Rye, and other g1·asseS, the same mnnberless
particles could be detected‚ when the viscid matter was dissolved that had
fastened them to such a situation, which made it evident that these marks
were occasioned hy some of the viscid liquid having applied to these organs,
and become dry from the loss of some portion of its watery constituents.

IIaving ascertained these facts, it was conceived that these minute bodies
in the liquid were connected with the means by which the ergot was ocea-
sioned and propagated‚ and were considered to be the sporidia of some fungus ε
therefore, how the liquid was generated‚ formed the next step in the inquiry‚ as
being an important part of the mystery.

This viscid liquid has been observed by most of the preceding investigators.
'Pessie1·‚ in his Traite' des lllaladies des Graius (1783, p. 37), speaks thus: “J’ai
vu ainsi que quelques physic-iens, sur des epis de seigle un suc visqueux, lui-
sant, d'an gout miclleux, qui enduisait rium-leur, l'exteriem· et les aretes meme
des halles ou etaient renfermes des ergots naissans ; mais plusieurs balles etant

* 'The observations that follow have resulted from the examination of some recent specimens of Er-
got on the Elymas sabalnsas, presented to me by Mr.2101111 Smith, and from those on Rye and several
other grass-es kindly lent nie by J. Pereira, Esq„ being the first example-s that Ι had the opportunity

of examining in a recent state; having osten obscrved the speeimens in the state in which thev

occur in the shops without ever being able to make out anythiug satisfactory respecting this anomalous

formation
