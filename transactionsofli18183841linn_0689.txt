DURING the last session‚ I submitted to the Linnean society drawings and
descriptions of some new inseets collected in Assum, and which have since
been published in the Transactions.

In consequence of my absence from London when the plates were engravcd,
the most remarkable form of the whole collection was omitted, partly as it
did not well accord with the first plate, consisting entirely ofLongicorn boenes,
and partly as the figures would have appeared too crowded for the sizc of a
quarto plate. At the suggestion of Mr. R. II. Solly, 1 have now tigured
that unique form under the name of C'lzeirntmms, and l have also given a
few othersf, and iu the course of the present paper it is my intention to
describe the remaining nondescript species in Mr. Gritlith's collection, and
to add such remarks as may tend to throw additional light upon the ento-
mology of a country almost yet. untonehed, but oue which, from the magui-
tude and splendour of the insects already known, will he found to vie with, if
not surpass, any others in the Old or even in the New world.

* In the Coleopterist's Manual the terius Cicimleloideu and Curaboirlca are adopted to include the
different families belonging to each of those groups: aud the term Lucunoiclea will compi-ise the Lam-
prirlte, Syntlesitla’, k‘assalidze, Sc„ in short, all the natural families into which Lucanas of Limnen> has
hitherto been subdivided.
