Natural Familss of lelts called Conifertc. 177

in a regular manner on arriving at maturity. In dilwotutris the lower edge
of each side of the modifled leaf assumes the condition of the cell of an ordi-
nary anthei· ; and here it is evident that both sui-faces are employed in fan-ming
the cells, for their walls are continuous with the substance of the scale: hut
in the rest of the (lum-essinerm it would seem that the upper surface of the
modified leaf or anther remains unchanged, and that a portion of the under
surface only becomes polliniferous‚ the pollen occupying 2, 3, or 5 separate
spots indicated by the raised and altered portions of the cuticle which cover
them. These polliniferous thecfe are analogous to the subdivisione of the
anthers of Rlzitoplmrew, Lauritww, Sec„ and are in all cases unilocular, and,
as far as. Ι have observed, destitute of any septum ; their line of dehiscence is
various, being sometimes in the direction of the axis, and sometimes contrary
to it. Ι ought to except ‚Illa-omiss and Pinus, in both of which the scales
differ but little from the ordinary condition of the anther in other plants. My
opinion of the scales being simple, and not originating from the confluence of
several anthei-ze, is founded upon their resemblance to the bractes, and their
transition through them to the proper leaves, from their nervafion, which is
entirely that of a simple leaf, exhibiting no traces of composition: and lastly,
from their assuming in Pinus and Atia-atavis the ordinary condition of the
simple anther. It may be worth nodeing, that in Athrotmvit· selaginoides,
where the leaves are acuminato, the apex of the anther is also pointed3 and in
cl. cupressoides‚ in which the leaves are obtuse, the anthei· is likewise blunt.
The wood of „alm-ommis presents nothing unusual in its structure, but resem-
bles that of (inflammet-Ia, except that the dots on the vessels are fewer.

1 am indebted to my friend Dr. Lindley for the opportunity of giving figures
and descriptions of both species of this curious genus, the specimens from
which they were taken being contained in his rich herbarium, and having
been sent to him, along with many other interesting plants, by Mr. Gunu, a
zealous botanist‚ who is settled at Launceston in Van Diemen's Land. The
d rawings have been done under my inspection by my young friend Mr. Kippist,
and they afford a good specimen of his success as a draughtsman.

'Phe generic name alludes to the crowded disposition of the leaves and scales
of the female spike‚ and is compounded of αθροοε, confertus, and ταξια, ordo.
