230 Jlr. BENTHAM'S Observations on some Genera of Plants

shining in ,S'.a‹lem›pl1ylla, Wall.‚ large, oblong, and rougl] in S. cerasisolia,
wall„ large, globular, and rough in 5’. mollis, Wall.‚ which appears very near
to ›S'.fe›·rzeginea, Roxb. I have not seen the fruit of the other species, but I
have no doubt that, when better known, the earpological characters will afford
good sectional distinctions.

Of the remaining published species, the. Szsmploeos nuda, Lim‹»1cill0‚ and
mum-onata, Ilumb. et Bonpl. Pl. AEquin„ and S. *Sl-ltiedeana, Schlechtendal,
(Linnzea, viii. 527.) must remain doubtful, as their corolla has not been seen.
S. pentagesna of Sprengel must be omitted altogether, having certainly no
connexion with .szsnz]1loc‹›.s. It would be impossible, indeed, without seeing his
specimen, to say what it might be, but at a guess his character reads most
like that of a Vis-mia.

The above genera, with S'tgsraoe, Strigiles, and Halesizr, form a small order,
or perhaps a tribe of Elaeam-ese, established by Richard under the name of
,Sterni-ece, and more or less adopted by most subsequent botanists, but with
very different ideas as to its extent. D. Don, followed by some others, esta-
blished three distinct orders, ›Symplocinfflg ,S'tgsraceoe, and Halm-lacem, the di-
stinctions between which arc thus stated by (ἱ. Don: Styracinece are “very
nearly allied to [halex-sacae, but differ by the decidedly superior ovariurn and
the more deeply-eleft corolla, and from Szsmploeinew in the superior ovarium
and entire or slightly-lobed calyx, and in the stamens being fewer and mona-
‹lelphous.” (Gen, Syst. of Gard. and Bot. iv. p. 4.) fflzlesiacew come “nearest
to hjtsmploeimue, from which they differ in the inferior ovarium, in the fruit
being a hard dry winged nut‚ and in the corolla being more decidedly mono-
petalous.'' (Ibid. p. 6.)

It. is difficult, however, not to agree with Richard in neglecting in this in-
stance, notwithstanding its great importance 111 other cases, the degree of
adbel-enee of the calyx to the fruit: for it will be found that at the time of
flowering the calyx adheres to the ovary at its base cven in SYyroer, and is
rarely completely adherent even in Halosin: whilst in the different species of
,symplocos and Hopea almost every intermediate degree may be observed.
The. chief difference lies in this: that, as the fruit swells, it is the adherent
part of the ovary that is developed in *Symploeog Hopea, and Halesz'a, and the
free portion only in §tyram and it is, Ι believe, generally recognized, that a
