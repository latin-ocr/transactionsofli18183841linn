In the earliest stage at which Ι have been able to examine the ovulum, Ι
find a similar adhesion of 1116 ον111111111 111111 calyx, The outline of the former
is 1115111161, and the eommunication of its apex with the 661111111 61111111 leading
from the base of the style open and very free†. There 15 110 development of
viseous tissue. Towards the apex ot' the ovarium there 15 11 cavity eommuni-
cating with the 61111111 leading from the stigma containing a cellular, mammil-
liform, central, but 1101 111111111056 body, attached by a broad base, 115 apex
touchiug almost the termination of the canal. This is connected iuferiorly by
a thickish opake line running through the 6611116 of the ovarium 10 115 111156.

period the nipple-shaped process, as Ι may eall it, 15 brownish‡.

No important change 0661115 1111111 after impregnati0n3 the only interme-
diate 01165 being the diminution of the diameter of the eanal, and its greater
length after impregnation, 50 far as may 116 judged of by the sphacelation of
the stigma, the process is very apparent; it is enlaiged, and its apex more
attenuated. From the base of the central 11116, which runs froin the base of
the process to the corresponding portion of the ovarium, two brown lines are
apparent, curved upwards and outwards. These lines are of a much deeper
brown thau the rest of the proeess; corresponding 10 0116 of the terminations
