Read November Qist, 1837.

AMONGST the inseet tribes, the order Ihmoptera must be admitted to
contain the most extraordinarily formed creatures to be met with in this class
of beings. In some the thorax is armed with balls and spinos² creseents,
sabi-es, and other inimic instruments of war: in others the same part is
transformed into a singularly dilated globe, concealing thc rest of the body,
or swelled out into an enormous caskct which would be far too hcavy to hear
were it not quite hollow. In others again, the head Is produced into an elon-
gated and swollen rostrum of the most singular construction, varying in the
different species), which is occasionally armed with spines or sanus, and some.-
times bent over the back. Of the use of these curious lnodifieations it is
difficult to form any idea. We are not indeed to suppose that aught has heen
made in vain3 bnt when we tind such an endless variety of form in the sanie
organ, we must be led to conclude either that the use for which it is bestowed
upon the creature is always modilied in accordance with the moditications in
its structurej or that the production of so many extraordinary variations in
organs not having a material influence upon the habits of the animals must
he considered as a inanit'estation of Divine power3 in which point ot' view the
contemplation of such productions is not without use.

Of these insects some of the most curions are the species of which Linnzeus
composed his genus Fulgura, hut which has become so much augmented hy
the addition ot' new species as to have been raised to the rank of a separate
family, named Fulgoridre by Dr. Leaeh and Fulget-eum by Latrcille. It is
in the most conspicuous of these. insects composing the modern restricted
genus Fulget-a, that the head exhibits those curious modifications ot' form
already noticed, and to which an additional interest attaches from the cir-
cumstance of these insects having long been regarded as possessing the power

of emitting a strong light from the anterior produced part of the head. Such
