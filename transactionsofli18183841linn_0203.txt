qurachis and Voandzeia. 161

Sixteen species of this genus have been lately characterized‚ and the new
ones described, by Dr. Vogel (Linnoea, v. xii. p. 63). He divides the genus into
two sections according to the presence and absence of the stipiform rudiment
of a flower in the same axilla as the perfect one. This character appears
constant in most instances, although in S. viscosa, Sw. (of which S. glutinosa
and S. humilis of Kunth are probably mere varieties) Ι have ohserved some·-
times two perfect flowers‚ sometimes a perfect one and a small stipiform rudi-
ment with four bracteolae, sometimes only the perfect flower with two, three,
or four bracteolae. Alnongst the very few new species I should have to add
to those of Vogel, there is nothing remarkable enough to make it worth while
‹lescribing them on this occasion.

The genus l'oamlzeia remains confined to the single 1⁷. subterranea, an.
Th.

Since the above has been in the press, Ι have received the second part of
Torrey and Gray's Flora of North America, in which is described a curious
new genus under the name of Chapmmmia, closely allied to 1S'tgslosm1thes in
structure, but with the habit ,of some species of *Es-chynonzene and Adesmia.
As I am indebted to the kindncss of the authors for specimcns containing
flowers in both stateS‚ l subjoin a full character drawn up in conformity with
those I have above given of ily-achis and δ’ῇιχῖοεαηίὴθκ, adding a description of
the fruit from a letter recently addressed by Dr. Torrey to Dr. Gray.
