‚S'tem prostrate, branc-hed, striated‚ smooth, the internodes as long or longer
than the leaves, except in the younger branches. Leaves narrowly ob-
‹›vate‚ often linear, acuminato, sessile, their margins reflexat, and the
nerve very prominent upon the under side. §ripales yellowish white,
short, torn, with a few faintly-marked nerves. Flowers axsslary, 2 or 3
together, minnte3 pedicels as long or longer than the flowers, and jointed
at about its middle. Fruit included in the calyx, trigonous; the faces
ovate, smooth and shining, obsoletely punctate-striate near to the apex,
and with a short striated stalk.

shortly stalked or sessile. Stipules white, lanceolate‚ long, but shorter
than the internodes, entire, at length torn, with few unbranched brown
nerves. Flowers axium-y, small, upon short pedicels‚ which are jointed Ι
just below the flower. Frm't small, triquetrous, equal to, or but little
longer, than the calyx, the faces triangularly ovate, acute, granulate-

striate.

This plant is so nearly related to P.‹11=ic1‹lm·e‚ that Ι have not ventui-ed 10

In the same paper with this plant there is a single specimen, without flow-
