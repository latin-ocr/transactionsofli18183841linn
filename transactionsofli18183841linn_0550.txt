connexion, at this period, with the receptaele than the grain itself pos-
sesses.

Philippar's exainination of the internal structure appears to have strength-
ened his view of its being a fungus; for he describes the body of the ergot to
116 601111165611 internally of branched short fibres and globules of various sizes‚
round and 611111, which he believes to be the means of its reprotluction. My
own observations on the inter-nal structure differ soinewhat from this, by
proviug that the fibres described are the boundaries of irregularly-sized 66115,
and not fibres at 1111; 111111 1116 globules are not reproductive bodies, but for the
most part those of a fatty oil and soine other granular matters, which are eon-
taincd 111 1116 interior of the cells, as seen in TAB. XXXIII. B. fig. 1., 1ν111611 15
a transverse slice inagnified six hundred times. In truth Ι have never seen
sporidia in the interior of the ergot, if care be taken to exclude those 011 the
exterior.

To witness these facts, take an ergot of rye, serape away all its blaek coar,
so as to remove all the sporidia which adhere to its surface; then inake 5111116
very thin transverse sliees, and let thein be put on a slip of glass under the
mieroscope3 when water is added to 1116111 it speedily becomes turbid or 111ilky.
on account of the numerous particles that have 6561111611 froin the cells z these
particles‚ however, are not leeavier than the water, 115 the sporidia 1116, but are
liglzter, and collect on the sui-face, froin whence they ean 116 removed, like
ereain froin the surfaee of inilk. then magniflui, they are found to be 111
very many sizes‚ some as large as the thousandth of an inch in (liaineter, and
others so small as to be scarcely visible by the highest inagnifying powers2

particlcs is hcatcd, these minute globules liquefy, running together and forin-

To observe the structure of the cells, let 5111116 thin sliees be made, 111111 boii
1116111 111 ether, which dissolves the 111111Υ matter, and renders them transparent.
so that the irregular cells ean 116 readily cxarnined, and by adding water after—
