Prof'. DON'S maograple (gftlze Genus Disporum. 523

This genus is essentially distinguished from Schellzztmmera by its sessile
biappendiculate sepals; by the statuens proceeding free from the torus, un-
counccted with the sepals; by the cells of its ovarium bearing only two
ovula; by its somewhat baccate pericarpimn; and, lastly, by its axillary
peduncles, which are furnished with three small verticillate hraetes. The
presence of appeudages, the spreadiug sepals‚ free stanuum, strophiolate secds2
minute embryo, axillary inflorescence, and valvular fruit remove it equally
fron] Disporlml.

My acute friend Mr. Smith, of the Royal Botauic Garden at ch, first drew
my attention to the remarkable appendages seated at. each side within the
base of the sepals‚ resembling those of Parnassia. ΜΓ. Brown having pointed
out to me the intimate connexion of these curious appendages with the sepals‚
aud the entire absence from them of vascularhy, Ι gladly seize this opportunity
of correcting au error into which Ι as well as Endlicher had fallen, in con-
sidering them as imperfectly developed stamina. These appcndages appear
to be of the same nature as those occurring on the sepals of (aloclzortus and
of many specics of Lilium. The chalaza occupies the middle of the seed,
which is considerably developed toward its outer and upper sides, and is
therefore, strictly speaking, hcmianatropous, the adherent funiculus, which
is imbedded in the fungous enlargement of the integument or testa, not ex-
tending beyond half the length of the seed.

Regarding this remarkable plant as a new gemm, I had named it Tripla-
denia ; but Mr. Brown having pointed out to me its identity with the Kreysigia
of Reichenbach, the latter name is here adopted.

In conclusion l may remark, that the cuticle of the under surface of the
leaves, like that of Paris and Trillium, consists of elegant sinuously lobed⁷ and
somewhat stelliform cellules3 the stomata are numerous, nearly orbicular,
and completely closed, but not arranged in regular rows as in thc generality
of Monocotyledous. The testa is composed of cubical celhsses, which are
more or less irregular in their outline, and of unequal size. They have thin
walls, and are furnished with a distinct elliptical nucleus. The contained fluid
is of a rich amber colom, and abounds with extremely minute globules appa-
rently of an oily nature. The albumen consists of a homogeneous mass, of a
horny texture, ancl furnished with innumerable and regularly disposed cavities
