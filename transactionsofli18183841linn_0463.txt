with some Remarlss οη tlte Nature of the Spongiae Marinae. 387

curious manner in which this diaphanous membrane is often puffed up, or
swells out from the surface of the gelatinous substance which it envelopes,
into little cones or roundish protuberauces, as well as the manner in which
these latter are sometimes seen to burst or become pierced at their summit,
and to vomit forth a continuous stream of water. And the mode in which 1
have observed the River Sponge grow and extend itself is owing· to this meiu-
brane, namely, by its transparent edges gradually progressing over the stone
or whatever body it is attached to3 and so by the bulging out and rising up of
the same membrane, the variously formed lobes and the irregular eminences
upon its surfaee originate and increase in size. The same author has likewise
attributed the increase of the Lake Sponge to the like membrane3 for he
says, ‘⁶ Elle forme une expansion membraneuse qui s'accroit par ses hords de
la meme muniere que eertaines Ulves *Γ

The second, is the gelatinous or soft portion itself covered by that mem—
brane, which when magnified appears of much the same nature as that con-
tained within the membrane of the inore fleshy kinds of leaves, and which
may be called the parenchymatous substance; for example, Ι compared a
piece of that Sponge with a portion of the leaves of Crassula coccinea, Iona
carnosa, several of the HIesembryam‘liema, Semperriva, Cacti particularly of
Caelus truncatus, Stapelia variegata, &c.; and placing oue next to the other
on the glass under the microscope, I could distinctly perceive that the pulpy
or gelatinous material of the Spongilla resembled the parenehynnatous sub-
stance of those leaves, and appeared to be principally composed of numerous
pellucid globules.

The third, the green chromule or eolouring matter which is contained in
these globules, and seems to be nearly the same with that of the more fleshy
leaves of plants; indeed, when squeezed on a piece of white paper, it stains it
of a green or yellowish-green colour according as the specimen of the Sponge
itself is of a dark or light green. I have brought this evening for inspection
a sheet of white paper, on which Ι have pressed out the green chromules from
the leaves of several phaenogainous plants for the sake of comparing them
with the similar green matter froin that Sponge, as well as some chromules of
different colours squeezed from the petals of certain flowers: all these it will
