frequent in such Sponge must be their eggs.”—“ Der Schwamm des siissen
wassers soll eine absonderung ihrer kohren oder zellen sein, ist sehr wahrschein-
lich. Die kijrner, welche man so hiiufig in 501611611 561111’11111111611 findet, sollen
die eier sein.''

Lamouroux, at page 3 of his “Hist. des Polyp. Corall. Flex.'' 1816, says,
“·Li11ne ...... (111 qu'en antonine on voit des semences dans l'Eponge fluviatile.
Kalm semble avoir copie le naturaliste Suedois. Ces auteurs prenaient pour
des fructifications‚ des Cristatelles dessechees, ou des grains opaqucs d'une
substance encore inconnue, dont les Eponges d'eau douce se trouvent quelque-
fois entierement re1nplies.''

Also, De Lamarck inquires, ‘⁶ Les petits grains observes dans les Spongilles
seraient—ils des gemmes propres ἓι produire les Cristatelles, comme l'obscrva-
tion, de Lichtenstein* semble l'indiquerP'' (p. 99. tom. ii. of ‘⁶ Hist. Nat. (les
Anim. sans Vert.,’' edit. 1816.)

Hence, from these last three passages, we find that Lamouroux held these
seedlike grains not to pertain to the ›S'pongillsn but that they were dried 01
withered Cristatelloe, or else certain opake grains belonging to some unknown
substance: and MM. Oken and Dc Lamarck inclined to consider them as
the eggs or reproductive germs or gemmules of the Cristatella vagans (De
Lamarek). This small polypary in its different stageS, and several of its po-
lypes, are well represented in Roesel’s “ Ι115661611,” vol. iii. tab. 91. p. 559.

Now 1 cannot for a moment suppose that these seedlike bodies are the
germs or ovules of the Cristatelloe, partly for this 1'eason3 because I have not
yet succeeded in discovering any of those minute Zoophytes in the same rivulet
which the Spongilla inhabits3 and as I have found the same bodies to be
abundant in different specimens of the Spongilla fluviatilis, not only in 1116
summer and autumn, but also in the spring: it is extremely remarkable, and
indeed most improbable, that I should not have been able to notice the Cris-
tatelloe in different stages of their development in that water, if these bodies
were in reality their ovules or germs; whilst, on the contrary, Ι have eon-

* There is an article by H. Lichtenstein on Sponges (Suesvampene) in “ Skrivter af Naturliistorie,”
4 Bind, 1 Hefte, Kiobenhavn, 1797, where he, at page 115 and the following page, speaks of the
river Sponge (Flod-suesvamp) : but, being written in Danish‚ Ι have not been able to read it, though
1 presume the author is the same Lichtenstein mentioned by De Lamarck.
