e. Brownish rather indistinct line running towards the excavation, in
which the now imperfect nucleus‚f‚ of a cordate shape‚ 15 deve-
loped. The same phaenomena occur as in Lommtlms Scurralu.

Fig. ll. Longitudinal section of a more advanced fruit; the figures have tho
same references. The mucilaginous or now viscous tissue. Ιι, is
much enlarged, and 15 deposited in cavities, which appear to be tole-
rably distinet from each other; the two basilar 01165, as in 501116
0111615, are the largest. d. The diminished remains of the 1111511111
partos the originally dense ovarium: it is the persistencc of this
portion that causes in part the production of the horus of the albu-
men. The line eis very distinct, and the tissue forming the mar-
gins of the now large cavity much sphacelated.

f. The albumen considerably altered iu shape. g. The young 6111-
bryo attached very slightly to the part of the albumen correspond-
ing to the terinination of the line e.

Fig. 12. Embryo detached to show the large evascular funiculus.

Fig. l. Longitudinal 56011011 of an ovarium of a Lorantlws, species unknown.
a short time after the fall of the flower. ιι. Outer tissue of parietes
of the calyx. h. lnner ditto commeneing to become viscous. c. Ova-
rium. d. Its base and denser portion, which produces the sanu-
effect on the albumen as above noticed. 6. The line (lescending from
the apex of the remains of the conical base of the style. f. Ovuluni.

Fig. 2. Section not truly central. a, b. Refer as before. c. The fibrous walls
of the ovarium. d. Its stalk, which is surroundcd by viscous tissue.

The sphacelated apex of the remaining base of the style is evident.
The eonununicating sphacelated line e has disappeared‚ the 1155116
eontinuous with the base of the style being truncate. e. The broad
cellular attaching process of the albumen. f. The albumen: rudi-
ments of two of its ascending cornua are visible. g. The embryo
hanging down into a cavity formed in the albumen by excavation.

Fig. 3. Embryo (letached. Its funiculus is long, loosely cellular, and evascular.
