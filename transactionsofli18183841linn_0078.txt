62 Mr. GRIFFITH on the Ovulum of Santalum album.

which cell is an extension of the inner wall of the corresponding part of the
tube, and cuts off the base of this from connnunication with the ascending
portion. Although the fruit of *S'cmtalmn is monospermous‚ yet the above
changes are not, as this would lead one to imagine, confined to one ovuluin.
The application of the filaments, as might indeed be expected from the situa-
tion of the points of the tubes, takes place frequently on all the ovula.

The abortion of these ovula is certainly, therefore, not ascribable to the non-
agency of the male influenee; neither is it to be attributed to pressure, or
indeed to any appreciable cause.

The remaining changes, which in fact constitute the history of the ovulum,
are limited, in accordanee with the structure of the ripe fruit, to one ovulum.
They take place within the (lilated part of the tube, in which the single cell,
as stated above, is first ‹leveloped3 and they consist in a further development
of 66115, and in a corresponding increase of size of this portion of the tube
itself. It appears at this period opake, owing to its being crowded with mole-
cules, which are aggregated into distinct gmups, perhaps corresponding with
some cellular division of the interior of this part of the tube. At a still later
period this portion is distinctly 6611111111, and most of the molecules have dis-
appeared; at the same 111116, 1116 constricted or narrow portion of the tube
prescnts indications of a cellular subdivision. As the development proceeds
the cells become more distinct, and end by oecupying the whole of the tube.
They are developed froin below upwards. 11711611 111656 66115 are completely
developed‚ the inembrane os the tube is not apparently visible; but we have a
lax cellular body, corresponding to it in shape, which still remains attached to
the ovulum. I should here mention that the tube, from the site of the develop-
ment of the small cell to its origin at the attachment of the ovulum, never un-
dergoes any change, except, perhaps, a diminution in the number of its mole-
eules. This cellular body continues enlarging‚ especially at its base, and
subsequently becomes a globose body with an apienlus, the point of which
continues applied to the apex of the placenta: the original attachment con-
tinues perfect. 11711611 1116 young fruit is further advanced, the placenta will
be found pushed to one side, and nearly inclosed in a depression of the ccllular
body. The original attachment os the base of the ovulum and of the tube still
continues perfect, and this latter may be found towards the centre of the
