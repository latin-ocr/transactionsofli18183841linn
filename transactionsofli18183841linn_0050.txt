3. Plu-agmites. Spiculae many-flowered‚ the lower-most imperfect and not
covered with hairs. Glumes membranous, the outer much the smallest.
Paleae 5011111156, unarmed. Panicle diffuse.

i. „lnzpelodesmns. Spieulae many-floweoed, the lowermost perfect, unless when
the inne)- glume is changed into αη ἰηιΙΜςῙέἰῚΐιήονσΐ. Glumes not opposite,
the outer rather the smallest, membrano-scariose. Paleae membranous.
Awn subterminal. Seed erested. Panicle diffuse.

It would appear from the above descriptions that the 11111616 111 AMMOPHILA

are the firmest; in ARUNDO they are about of equal consistency‚ 01· the palece
are the firmest. „ll-undo is variously awned: the awu is said to he sometimes

from the midrih between the two subulate points of the outer palea. In
A. Plinii and A. mauritanica the outer palea gradually tapers into a long

CHLoRmi-:AE

The European genera of this tribe are few, aud are easily known by 111611·
111110165001106, 1116 spieulae being placed in two rows 011 0116 side of a flattened
rachis, without any tendency to form an imperfect exterior floret. There is
sometimes only one floret, with an interior, stalk-like rudiment‚ aud sometimes
more than one perfect floret. Kunth adds, that the superior is 1116 exterior
glume3 but ifI understand him aright, there are few (ἐι-115565 111 which it ean
be determined‚ where this is not the case. This I have already stated in the pre-
liminary observations. I may add, that in the Chloridem the glumes and paleae
are nearly of equal consisteney‚ or the latter rather the thinuest‚ 111111 111111, 111
1116 European speeies at least, though there is in some instances something of a

point formed hy the continuation of the 1111111111, there is 110 awn. The genera
are:

l. Cymodon. Spikes fingered. Spiculae 1-fi0wered‚ with an interior rudiment.
