14 Mr. Woons on the Genera (ᾖ Europam Grasses.

1 have already notieed Zea as the only (ἐι-1155 within my limits where the
barren and fertile flowers are on different parts of the plant. Ι may add, that
it is the only one where there are no spiculae containing all the parts necessary
sor the reproduetion of the plants. Ilordeum, Amlropogml, 111111 Sorglmm have
1115111101 anthei-iserous 5111011110 mixed with the perfect ones. Halous, Hieroelzloa,
and „lm-henathot-mn have barren florets containing anthers only, mixed with
the perfect 01105 111 1110 same spicula. The Pham-idea> and Paniceoe have 11110
01· two abortive external florets; this occurs also in Plzrargmiz‘es> and some-
times in :impelrulesmus. The addition of an upper abortive floret occurs in
many Grasses, as well in the many-flowered ones as in those which have but
0110 perfect floret, and perhaps may serve as an accessory 111 determining the
gemis of a (ἐι-1155, though I think it cannot always bc depended upon even 115

that the glmnes are wanting in Lem-sia, (blesmtlms, and Nartlus. They are

remaining speeies of Lepturus, and in some degree in ⁴Ege‘lops. The general
arrangement presents 115 two glnmes 011 opposite sides of the spicula, 11111 0110

largest. The ternis imzer and ‹mter with respect to glmnes may be used

We see it clearly in Lolimn3 11111 111 111051 of the spiked Οτι-115505, where the ar-
rangement is most evident, the position of the glumes seems to be eqnidistant

upper and lower as applied to individual spiculae, imler and outer to the more
general inflorescence. Of the palere we 1111151 speak always with reference 10

comparative size of the glnmes is taken for granted in the description of most
