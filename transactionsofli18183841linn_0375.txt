I AM indebted to my friend and colleague Dr. Royle for the opportunity of
presenting to the Linnean Society the following account of several interesting
species of the beautiful genus Iris, derived from materials collected by him
during his sojourn in the countries forming the north-west boundary of Bri-
tish India. Dr. Royle’s collection contains four speeies of this genus, one of
which is entirely new, the other three being identieal with those in the Wal-
lichian Herbarium, which besides comprises two additional species: one of
them, gathered in Ladak by that enterprising traveller‚ the late Mr. Moor-
croft, and closely related to the Iris biglumis of Vahl, Ι have included in this
paper3 the other is from Armenia, and is the Iris reticulata of the “Flora
Tam-ico-cummim? although recorded, apparently on the authority of M.
Belanger, as Iris persica in Wallich's Catalogue. The number of species
therefore actually belonging to the Indian Flora is five.

The species of this genus naturally divide themselves into two groups, which
are characterized by certain differences in their structure and oeconomy, and
in some degree by their geographical distribution. The first group have sca-
riose spathes, a distinct tube, the sepals bearded, and the petals broader5
and overlapping each other at their extremities. To this group belongs the
far greater part of the European species, which are also remarkable for being
early-flowering, the broad couvergent petals serving to protect the stamens
and pistil from the effects of the weather during the period of their blossom-
ing, and the beai-ded crest of the sepals is doubtless for the purpose of brush-
ing out and retaining the pollen until taken up by the recurved stigmas
whose absorbing apices are brought into close contact with it.; the anthei-s
are directly opposed to the erest, and their cells face outwards. The second
