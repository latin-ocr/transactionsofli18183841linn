rior sui-face of the left margin of the live1·; it is sunl< in the substance of the
liver, with part of its surface exposed. The gall-bladder receives the bile by
two cyst-hepatie ducts which enter its cervix, and the secretion 15 carried to
the intestine by a single, short⁷ but moderately wide cystic duct†‚ which ter-
minates close to the pyloms, and by a similar but smaller valvular projection.
Most of the veins of the abdominal viscera and of the abdomina! parietes
contribute. to form the vena portae: the hepatic vehis are four or five in 1111111-
ber, but there 1511 principal one ζ, which emerges from the anterior part of the
liver and forms the vena cava. This great vein, with three other vascular
trunks, viz. thc aorta, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein, penetrate the
septum which forms the anterior wall of the abdominal cavity. This septum
is formed by the fihrous membrane of the abdomen, which is then continued
around the pericardiuin, to which it is united by a cellular medium : a portion
of it is 50011 reflected in TAB. XXV. fig. l, cl. After dissecting away this fibi-ons
tunic the true pericardiumgK is brought into view: it is protected by the cora-
coid bones, which meet below it: one of these is seen turned back in fig.3‚.2·.
