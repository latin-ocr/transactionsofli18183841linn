Mr. BENTffl-M’s Accozmt of tei-0 new Genera allied to Olacineae. 673

The calyx at the time of flowering is very small, cupuliform, with the inar-
gin entire, or bearing as many minute teeth as there are petals. It is quite
free in Ximenia, Hasta-ia, Gomplmndru, Icacina, Apodytex, Leretia and Pogo-
petalum‚ very slightly adherent. to the ovary in the East Indian and Australian
species of Olaoe, and decidedly adherent, with a very short, free and entire
margin in the American species of Olaoe and in *S'cllwlfim In opilia and
Cwmjera it is little more than a dilatation of the torus with four or five
scarcely perceptible teeth, so that these genera appear at first sight mono-
chlamydeous. As the fruit ripens the calyx of Olaiv enlarges and incloses the
drnpe nearly to the top, but without adhering to it. In Sclzoelffl'a it enlarges
in the same manner, but adheres closely to the fruit, as in *S'ymplocoau In
Heisleria it becomes also much enlarged‚ but is spread out under the fruit
without inclosing it. In Ximenia, Opilia, Gsmzplmmlra³ Apodqtes, Icacina.
Leretia and Pogopetalums it persists, but does not increase in size.

The corolla, hypogynous where the calyx is entirely free, inore or less
perigynous according to the degree of adherence of the caIyX‚ consists of
four, five or six petals, always valvate in their aestivation‚ usually of a thick-
ish consistence, and inore oi· less cucullate at the apex, where they usually
terminate in an inflexed point. They cohere together in the form of a
monopetalous corolla above the middle in *S'clzoepfia and Ccnijera3 they are
joined in pairs in oms, and often cohere slightly at the base in the other
genera, hut usually are entirely detached from each other when the fiower is
fully open.

'Phe stamens‚ inserted with the petals‚ are free, or more or less connected
with the latter; their number is definite, and never exceeds double that of the
petals. When this number is complete they are placed in two series, the inner
one opposite the petals‚ the outer one alternating with thern. In Ximenia
and Heisteria both series are complete and fertile. In Gomplzandra, Icacina,
Apodytes‚ Leretia and Pogopetalm the outer series are alone complete and
fertile, the inner one being wanting. In Olaae the outer series are complete,
but reduced to three (or sometimes four?)‚ the inner series reduced to simple
or bifid filaments. In opilia and Canqjera the outer series are reduced to
scale-like pmcesses, whilst the inner are complete and fertile. In Sclzoelffiu
the inner series are also complete and fertile, but the outer ones are totally
