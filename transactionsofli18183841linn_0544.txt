460 Mr. E. J. QUEKETT on tlze Ergot qugse,

carp, which 1105 110011 1111011 up to 11115 1101111 by the seed in the interior putting
011 a 51010 of development 11100111110111110 with the usual growth os that part.
It 1105 now become shrivelled from no longer containing the 50011, and 1110501115
111 1110 view a mass of broken-down 11010115 115500, 50 much so, that no regular
structure ean he made out of this 05 out of other parts of the diseased grain,
though Leveill(¹ mentions there are four or five parts radiating from the 0011110,
but 111050 appear nothing but those caused by its shriveling.

The proportion 11115 appendage bears to the ergot is subject to 1110011 varia-
tion‚ 05 111 1110 Elymus most frequently is found nothing beyond a tuft of 110115
precisely such 05 exist 011 1110 healthy grain; but occasionally there 15 501110
remaining part of the pericarp, which 15 variable in Size. In the rye the ap-
pendage 15 generally of about the 501110 size, vix. one sixth or one eighth the
length of the ergot‚ and appears to 00115151 1nostly of shriveled pericarp‚ on
the apex 01 which 15 occasionally a sunken depression and a few rigid 110115

appendage 15 50101101, and oecasionally 501110 fragments of what appear peri-
carpial eovering can bc detected on various parts of the body of the ergot.

Thus it appears that 11115 appendage 15 formed by the perieurp not growing

taining 501110 0111105100, 11 1100011105 1111011 up to the apex of the ergot by the
great elongation of the seed, not always being eentral, often 1111 one 51110, 01111
its base strained over the apex of the ergotized grain, and not partaking os the
nature of a fungus, 05 Leveillt'¹ iniagined.

The number of ergots in any one spike of a grass 15 subject 10 11111011 varia-
tion 2 in Elymus sabulosm· there occur a great many, but in the 50101101· grasses
only one 01· two, 01111 111 1110 rye the number 501110111 exeeeds five or 51Χ. The
appendage that each 1105505505 111 115 perfect 51010 15 scarcely ever to be found
existing 011 those 5110011110115 which are sold in the 5110115, being generally
rnbbed off in the collection of the 5110011110115.

On pursuing the exainination on the 5110111110 that exist on the exterior of
the ergot, they were found to be of a lengthened oval figure, having their
511105 occasionally a little eontraeted about niidway, of the forms represented
01 Tm. XXXIII. B. lig. 3. ; there are, however, 501110 variationis in 5110110, 501110
being nearly round, 01111 0111015 being longer than those in the above figures.
