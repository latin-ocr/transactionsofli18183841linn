492 Mr. VALENTINE on the ›S'truelm‘e aml Derelopment

connexion with this subject Ι shall take the opportunity of observing‚ that
froin a partial exaniination of Lycopmlium and Issa-stes, I believe Dr. Lindley
is also correct as to the pulverulent inatter of those genera being abortive spo—
rules. I at first intended to add to this paper smne general observations on
the several groups which colnpose the Ctyspt‹›ganzia of Linnaeus, but I now
think it inore desirable to defer this until they have been separately sulnnitted
to examination3 for without an accurate knowledge of their structure and

germination, it is impossible to arrive at. a satisfactory conclusion as to their

allinities. 1 cannot help observing, however, that Dr. Lindley has not in iny
opinion exercised his usual j udgnient in reinoving Eqnl'.s·eta‹·eoe fron} derogem·

to Gymnoa-perman The affinity which they have to the latter is entirely in their
aspect; there is no obvious struetural or physiological analogy between thein.
The supposition of Brtmgniart, that the reproduetive body is a naked ovule,
and the four filauients that surmnnd it four grains of pollen, without the power,
according to Lindley, of perforastng theii· function, is contradictory; for what
evidence have we of any fertile ovule without the agency of the {nale organ?
Besides, this supposed ovule is admitted in the sanie paragraph to be a sporule‚
and afterwards proved to be such by its gemnination.

This account of Pilularia shows that it is iu‹·orrcct to say of slrrogens that.
‘⁴ gerinination takes place at no fixed point, but upon any part of the surfacc
of the spores;” sor it is quite certain in this instance that gerinination in-
variahly takes place at a tixed spot, which may he pointed out before germi-
nation has connnenced. lt is at that. part. of the sporule indicated by the
three radiating lines which appear to have been produced by the pressure of
the three other sporules that originally helped to constitute the quaternary
union; and as the spores of all the other tribes appear, according to Mohl, to
be developed in similar uniens, it is most probable that similar lines indi-
cating a valvulam· ‹lehiseenee also exist on theni. This is certainly the case in
some Mosses, for instance, in OEclipodiwn, and in Anates, Lgscopodium, and
Osmzonla regali-sq and in those instances where such a structure is not visible,
it is probably owing to a thieltening of the ine1nbrane, or a deposition of
opake matter on its surface, as in Pilularia. In the mature sporules of Pila-
laria they can only be discovered by dissection, and in the abortive ones they
cannot be discovered at all after the first stages of their growth ; whilst, again,
