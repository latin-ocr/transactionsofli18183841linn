Fig. 3. A fertile sporule, with its gelatinous covering: this and all the subse-
quent figures are highly magnified.

Fig. 4. Upper portion of a spot-ule, in which the outer membr-ane is deficient
on the conical projection, in consequence of which the more delicate
middle membrane is collapscd, and gives a truncated appearance to
the sporule.

Tg. 5. Α perpendicular view of this truncated conical projection. a. The
short outcr mcmhrane. b. The middle membrane, with an aperture
and several lines on its surface.

Fig. (ἱ. Α section of a sporule, showing an outcr coat, which is much thick-
encd and of a cellular appearance, at the upper part of the sporule,
and may he traced on to the conical projection; a middle memhrane,
which may also he traced into the conical projection: and the third
or internal coat, which does not. assist in forming the conical pro-
jection, but, passing transversely across its base, forms a short cavity.
The granular contents are also shown in situ.

Fiw. 7. A few of the granular contenis of various sizes3 the)v refract the trans-
mitted light to the centro.

Fig. 8. A perpendicular view of a sporule, the conical projection being re-
moved to show the transverse portion of the internal coat. The
three radiating lines indicate a valvular structure.

Fig. 9, A similar view ofa germinating sporule. The germ has ruptured the
volves.

Fig. 10. The germ separated, to show its attachment to a delicate membrane
which lines the whole cavity of the sporule.

Fig. l Ι. Section of the upper part of a germinating sporule, showing the germ
before the rupture of the valves. lt will he now seen, that there is
an additional membrano to the sporule with which the germ is con-
tinuous.

Fig. 12. View of the upper part of a germinating sporule, which is more ad-
vanced3 the conical projection is dilated hythe pressure of the grow-
ing germ, four of the cells of which are visihle externally.

Fig. 13. View of a germinating sponde, not quite so far advanced as the
preceding. The conical projection has been removed to show
