of which the two lowermost, and very rarely a third, are fertile; one is, Ι
believe, always neuter, and sometimes a second.

There is no other genus in the European Flora which can be associated
with this tribe, for Cisnodrm, though resembling Digifmv'a in habit, wants the
trace of an abortive exterior floret. It is true that in the one-glumed species
of Digitio-ia it might be difficult to determine that the second valve was any-
thing but a superior glume, but the 1·udi1nent of a superior floret in Cisnodon
will assist our judgement at least in rejecting that genus from the present

tribe.
ORYZEAE.

It would hardly be allowable to draw up any character of this tribe from
the only two European species which it contains. These agree in having the
spiculae scattered in a loose equal panicle, each of one perfect floret, without
any additional rudiment either internal or external. The glumes are small
and distant, or wholly wanting. The palere. are of equal length, nearly val-
vular, meinbrano-l]erbaceous, the outer deeply concave aud boat-shaped.
The foreign genera assigned to this tribe by Kunth have florets of different
sorts‚ or at least an evident, though, perhaps, very imperfect rudiment, but
none have more than one perfect floret in the spicula. I have only to notice,

1. Lem-sia. Glumes O. Outer palea ribbed. Stamens 3.
2. Oryza. Gluines 2, not precisely opposite. Outer palea ribbed and grained

The small and apparently inefficient glumes distinguish this tribe from our
other single-flowered Grasses. Coleantlms, indeed, has no glumes, and pro-
bably 011 that account has been placed in this tribe by Reichenbach ; but the
paleae of unequal length, one embracing the other, and the small size and
delicate appearance announcc a greater affinity with the Agros-tidem. The
glunies are wanting also in Lzsgeum and Nardns, but neither of these plants

approach in other respects to the Oryzece.

PHALARIDEAE.

l only admit into this tribe such plants as show a tendency to produce one
or two external imperfect florets, and no indication of a superior one; the
