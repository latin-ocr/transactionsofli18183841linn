These have two glumes, one of which 15 generally much smaller than the
other, and sometimes reduced to a hardly distinguishable rudimcnt. Within
these we find what appears in the European genera to be a third glnme, but

l. Digitaria. ‚Spikes fingered‚ unarmed.
2. Ostia-menas. Spike 60111110111111; 0116-5111611 111 1116 whole and in each part.

Spiculae nakcd.
B. 8111611116 not. on such a rachis.

3. Sena-ia. Spike compact, cylindrical. Spiculae surrounded by an involu-
crum of simple bristles!

4. Pennisetum. Spike compact, cylindrical. Interior bristles 0f the involu-
6111111 featheryl

5. Panicum. 8111611116 111 a scattered 1111111616, unarmed. Glumes and abortive
paleae of similar texture.
