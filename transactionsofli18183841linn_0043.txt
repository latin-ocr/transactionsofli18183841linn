totally wanting; but I have already stated in my observations on that tribe
the reasons which induce me to place it here. The want of any trace of an
exterior rudiment, as well as the more delicate texture of the palere, keep them
away from the Panicew and Pllttlaridew, and they have not those long silky
hairs which distinguish the Arumlinacew. The last character is, I must con-
fes& the least satisfactory, for some species of Agros-tis have soft hairs and
not very short ones, so that without the smaller size and more delicate tex-
ture of the plant one might be at a loss in which tribe to place it.

Genera t

1. Ρωζιψυὸτοη. Glumes scariose, furnished with a long seta} Paleae nearly
equal, filmy, included. Awn dorsal‚ or none.

2. Milium. Glumes herbaceo-scariose, hardly exeeeding the membrano-ro-
riaceous paleae. Paleae nearly equal, unarmed, hai-dening on the seed!

3. Agr‹›.s·tis. Gluines membraneus, acute. Paleae smooth‚ scal-iose, unequal
in length, the inncr sometimes wanting. The awn, if any, is dorsal.

4. l'ilfiz. Glumes unequal, falling short of the paleae, both membranous.
Paleae nearly equal, unarmed.

5. Coleantlzus. Glumes 03 flowers solitary3 paleae unequal; the outer with
a rough keel, terminating in a short seta. »Stamens 23

6. Knappia. Inflorescenee in a raceme, somewhat one-sided. Spiculae trun-
cate. Paleae included, scariose or filmy, shaggy, the inner minute or

wanting.

The awn is wanting in Polypogon maritimzmz; where it occurs it is easily
separablc from the corolla, and is therefore a true awn. The long terminal
seta of the glume in this genus is very remarkable, separating it at once from
almost all others. Smith and Hooker describe it as strictly terminal. To
me it seems to be placed a little below the extremity.

Mamm. M. egfficsam is the only European species left by Kunth in this
genus, and he places it among the Paniceoe, considet-ing the part which has
the appearance of an inner glume, and which is quite similar in form and tex-
ture to the outer glume, as a neutral floret. There is nothing in the structure
or disposition of the parts to countenance such an hypothesis, and I therefore
consider it as belonging to the Agrosticleae. VILFA of Link offers only one
