226 Mr. BENTHAM'S Observations οη some Genera ofPlants

serie quadruplici corollae tubo acereta, inferioribus brevioribus. Anthene sub-
rotundzc. Germen subi-otundum. ›S'lJJlH-s· filiformis, longitudine staminum.
Stigma capitatum sul›t1·ilidum.”

The above character will be found in every respect, as far as it goes, ad—
mirahly adapted to l'ohl’s Stemnzrtto.s·ipl1‹ms‚ as well as to the original Sisnzplocos,
aud to Aublct's C'iponima3 for although thc words Petala quinque rather indi-
catc a polypctalous corolla, yct thcir adhereuce at the base is plainly indiCated
by thc subsequcnt expression, Filamenta . . . . tulto corollw acereta.

L’Ilcriticr iu thc first volume of the Liuncan Transactions (p. 174.) first
proposed the joining the genera [Iopen (Limz. Allant. p. l4.), Alstonia (Lina.
Fil. Suppl. }›.·‘3!').)‚ and (Ypsminm (dubl. Plant. Gaiam, i. p. 567. t. 226.) to
&Jaesmplncmg of which it became conscqucntly necessary to modify the character

iu many points, of which the most important are, Calffir superus quinquepar-

titus. Cat-olla . . . . campanulata . . . . petalis s. laciniis 5—10 . . . . basi in
tubum longitudine calycis coalitis . . . . Filmnenta . . . . submonadelpha s. basi
iurequaliter connexa . . . . in plures ordines imbricata . . . . Germen inferum
..... ‘ilignea . . . . subquinquclobum. To these were also added the cai-polo-

gical characters, Linnacus himself not having seen the fruit of his Sszplocm.

Iu regal-d to the rclatix'(¹ situation of the calyx and ovarium (or germen, as
it was formerly tcrmcd,) thcre is herc au inconvenience in expression still
adhercd to generally hy British botanists, although long since advertcd to aud
corrccted hy contiucutal authors, who §peak of the calyx as free or adnate,
instead of offerint· and salim-ior. In bysmplocos aud in all the genera associated
with it the tube ot' thc calyx is generally more 01· less free from the ovary at
the timo of flowcriug, hut with the development of the fruit it adheres to it
uiorc and more, till, at the maturity, the tube of the calyx becomes entirely
confouudcd with the flcsliy pericarp, and the segments alone remain free,
crowning the. fruit at thc top,—a circumstance difficult to describe With the
old nomenclature, unless οι] the supposiffion, that during the maturation the
calyx movcs from its original point of insertion.

As to the corolla aud stamina, L'Heriticr's character, intended to apply both
to bjzflnplocos, Lam„ and IIolufa, Liun., is not so correct as Linnaeus’s sor the
former genus, 1101· does it either apply with accuracy to the latter oue, which
has scarcely any tube to the corolla, and in which the stamina cannot be said to
