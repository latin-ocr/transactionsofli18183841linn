Natural Famlly qf’Plam‘s called Coniferae. 165

The work of Richard already mentioned, although of great valae in a sy-
stematic point of view⁷ threw comparatively little additional light upon the
organization of this remarkable family of platus, from the circumstance of its
learned author having either misunderstood or wholly overlooked many parts
of their structure. We are indebted to Mr. Brown for having first pointed out
the real nature of the parts of the female flower in this family. Richard, as is
well known, adopted in a great measure the views of preceding botanists. He
regarded the expunded periearpia as brac-tes, the ovula as the flowers, the in-
tegument as the calyx and the apex ot‘ the nucleus as the stigma, and the fleshy
outer integument of the ovulum of 'lim-us (which is devehiped after fecunda—
tion) as a kind of involucrum. Ile moreover describes the flowers as inverted
in Abietinew, and ereet, in (aqu-essinae and 'l'mrinew5 and he considered the
ovulum (nucleus) to follow the direction ofthe nowers. The two genera, which
form the >ubject of this communieation, belone¹ to the Casu-esxt'new, a group di-
stinguiffihed, as l have before stated, by the tendeney of their rcproduetive or-
gans to become indefinite, by their persistent pericarpia. naked buds, and other
peculiarities of habit. To his character of the group Richard added the form
ot' the mature female spike, which is usually a galbulas, compffied of peltate
senam but in the two genera which l am about to describe, that organ has
assumed nearly the form of a eone, as in Pinus. The genera comprised in the
Cupressinew are (¹11J11·‹‘.s:›·tts, Tlezgja, ( 'alll'tt'l.v‚ Tawwlium, tlnnipems. and the
subjeets of the present paper. The structure of the fruit of sziperus differs
only from (lusu-exeas, in the peltate scales becoming confluent and tleshy as the
fruit ad vances towards maturity. This will be best understood by examining
the female spike at an early stage„ when it is scarcely pmsible to distinguish
between the two genera. From its fleshy fruit §onie have supposed that
Jnniperus was related to Utens: but that is a mere point of analogy⁷ for in
sziperus the flowers and ovula are indefinite, and the ¹<cales or perleui-piu
unite and become fleshy, while in Tati-em the female spike is reduced to a
single flowe.r² with a solitaiw, completely naked ovulum, whose outer integu-
ment becomes sueculent, and altogether resembles a fleshy arillus.

The speeies¹ of this group are prett)⁷ equally distributed in both hemisphein
but none of the genera are strictly confined to either⁷ with the exception ot'
'Fas-odiunt and Crysln‘omeria to the noi-thetin and „latratui-as to the southern.
