with doubt, as identical with (Ι. M‹1‹·Leaii. Mr. Mac-Leay himself, the pos-
sessor of the specimens described by Swederus and Donovan, having found a
new species of the genus in Dr. Smith's African collection, published a Mono-
graph of this genus in the first portion of thc Annulosa of Dr. Smith's work,
containing descriptions and figures of four species, namely‚ seraptem& latipes,
Han-{fieldiss ,S'mitlzii and Mat-Lean, the last of which he separated as a distinct
subgenus under the name of Artlzropterus.

Iu a Subsequent notice on this genus, rendered necessary by the publication
of Mr. MaeLeay's Monograph, Ι arranged the five species with which I was
then acquainted in the following manner:

Subgenus l. Cet-apteras propr. C. latipes. Swed.; and Hor-sfi'eIAII. Westxv.
Subgcnus 2. (thhopterus. lVestw. (J. Smitldi. Mac-L.

Subgenus 3. Artltropterzts. MacL. C. MacLeaii. Donov.

Subgenus 4. Phym[domm-us. W'estw. C. piceus. VVestw.

In addition to the species from South America mentioned at the connuence-
ment of this paper, I have further become acquainted with two more new
species of this curious genus, sent to me by Mr. Westemnann of Copenhagen,
the possessor of a splendid collection of insccts, and to whom Ι am indehted
for many valuable additions to my collection. As one of Mr. VVcstermann's
species and that of ΜΓ. Miers constitute two remarkahly distinct subgenera,
it will be serviceable to offer the following synopsis of this genus, now con*

sisting of eight distinct species.
