Mr. VALENTINE οη the aristence of Stomata in Messes. ‘241

tracting so as to close this cavity, fig. l. and fig. 2., thereby forming an addi-
tional impediment to evaporation or respiratiom as the case may be. The
nearest approach to this structure is in Jlarshantia and 'I'argi‹1›1[a‚ in which
the stomata are formed of several layers of cells, one above the other, and con-
tracting npwards so as to produce a hollow truncated cone.

The obturator ring described hy Mirbel does not exist, as was ascertained
by Griffith to be the case with Targhmia lzypoplzylla, but instead there is a
quantity of short perpendicular filaments, which project into and form the
floor of the cavity of the stoma, and are scated on a dense mass of roundish
cells which contain a great quantity of green granules. The specics of Mar-
rlmntia which was the subject of Mirbel's obscrvations is not mentioned in
Lindley's Botany, one of the tracts published by the ›Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge3 and as my knowledge of this subject is obtained from
a second source, you cannot expect it to be so clear as it would have been if
Ι had had the original memoir to consult.- If Mirbcl describes the obturator
ring as common to all the specics, he is wrong3 but it is more probable that
his remarks apply to polymorpho, the most common specics, and as that is not
immediately within my reach, l cannot either confirm or contradict him.
There is this important peculiarity in the stomata of mco-chamin conica—it
has not the power of contracting after having been once pervious.

TAB. XXI. fig. 6, 7, 8, and 9 represent the stomata of meria leygromestica,
each of which consists of a single cell in the form of a hollow ring, the sides
being so compressed as to convert. the aperturc into a mere slit. They only
occur on the apophysis, which is composcd of very loose cellular tissue (exeept-
ing its centre),and through the intercellnlar spaces of this tissue they allowof
acommunication between the external air and the space between the sporular
and theeal membranes. In Ortltotriclnmz cliaplzanum the stomata open directly
into this space, and 1 believe, although Ι have not been able to prove it, that
in all mosses the stomata communicate with this space. All the cells exposed
to the action of the air contain green granules3 and some, as those forming
the external layer of the columella, which have no apparent communication
with the air, also contain them, although in a less degree, and occasionally a
few granules are scattered in the cells which form the substance of the eolu-
mella, as shown in fig. l.; the more retii-ed, however, the cells arc from the
