This· specics is pretty generally diffused throughout the niountainous parts
ot‘ central and southern Europe, occurring in shady woods, and flowering in
the months of June and July. lt was originally discovered in the year 1576
hy the accurate and indefatigahle Clusius, as he himself states, in shady
woods on Mount lVechseL and at Durrenstein in Austria3 and a faithful
woodcnt and description of the plant were given by him in his Barim-mn
,S'tirln’mn Hism-ia, which appeared in 1583. This woodcut is repeated in his
Historia plantarum, published in 1601 ς and copies from the same occur in
the works of Taberntemontanus, Geramle, Morisml, and Barrelier. There are
two other original woodcuts of the plant, namely, those given in the Epitome
of Camerarius, which appeared in 1556, and in the Valgrisian edition of
Matthiolus‚ puhlislied at Venice in 1533. This last represents the plant
wholly in fruit, and with straIght peduncles. In the cuts of Clusius and
Camerarius, which last is repeated in Bauhin's Historia Plantarum, the
singular twisting of the pednneles is rudcly represented. I am not satisfied
that the apparent originality of the eut given hy Camerarius is not due to the
artist‚ who may have copied from Clusius, and introduced some alterations of
his own, for the figure is very faulty.

This species is found likewise in North America, having been first observesl
by Michaux in shady woods in Canada, and since by Pursh on the niountains
of Pelmsylvania; and Dr. Beck reeords it as indigcnous to the State of New
York. It was cultivated by Philip Miller in Chelsea Garden in 1752, but the
plant is even now rarcly to be seen in collections. The singular contortion
of the delicate peduncles appears to be for the purpose of keeping the flowers
from being injured, and their fecundation impeded by coming in contact with
