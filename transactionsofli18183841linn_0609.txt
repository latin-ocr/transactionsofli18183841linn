paradoxical as it inay seem, differs only froin scalaria in its habit, less decply
separated styles‚ and in the strictly marginal position of the cells of its an-
thei-s.

The class of Monocotyledonous plants offers a beautiful confirmation of the
truth of the doctrine of the eontinuity of the series of organized beings; and
however much the universal existence of transition or osculant genera in this
class may perplex the botanist who looks to the technical definition of his
groups as the highest object of the science, we are not to exclude such genera
fron] our researches merely because their presence renders the circumscription
of our pretended natural orders more difficult, for they certainly form the
niost interesting part of the study of natural affinities.

Being aware of the near allinity of Schellz«onmem to Dispm'zmz, Ι was induced
to examine a supposed speeies of that genus, which annually flowers and ula-
tures its fruit in one of the green-houses in the Royal Botanic (iarden at Kew,
and Ι found that. it not only differed essentially fron} Πίερον-μω, but likewise
froin *SI-ltellzammera itself‚ constituting a distinct genus froin both. To enable
my readers the better to conti-ast its characters with Hispal-um, a description
of that genus is subjoined to the present communication. IIaviug, as Ι trust,
sufficiently explained my views as to the affinities of Disporum, 1 shall now
proceed to the description of the genus, and of the species belonging to it.
