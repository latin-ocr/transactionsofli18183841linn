of this plate is turned forwards, the apex expands into an oblique elliptical
plaste, having a shallow depression, which receives the pointed anterior ex—
tremity of the gelatinous chorcl. The fibrous capsule of the chord is attached
to the margin of the. basi-occipital depression, and supports the neurapophyses
of the atlas, anterior to which are the corresponding elements of the occipital
vertebra itself. These οκοοοίρίῖῑιίεῆ(ἶ present the form of thin expanded 1)lateS‚
of a sannadrate figure, coneave towards the medulla oblongata, which they
defend and cmbraee, their anterior and inferior extremities being extended into
the npper part of the capsule of the fibrous chord, as far as the middle line, like
the bases of the ordinary neni-apophyses ι their npper extremitics meet above by
an extendcd superior margin. The basi-occipital is notched below the base of
each cxoecipital, leaving a foramen for the transmission of a large nerve. The
limite· of the basi-occipital and sphenoid bones are indicated by a transverse
groove. The basi-splwnoid sends upwards, near its outer margin, two low
longitndinal vertical plates, which give attachment to the cartilaginous alze
of the sphenoid forming the lateral parietes of the cranial cavity†. Between
these alae and the cx-occipital bony plates is interposed on each side the large
and thick cartilaginons capsule of the organ os hearing-221, which is, extcnded
upwards to the parietal b011c,a11d represents the petrons and squameus ele-
ments of the temporal boue. There is no distinct supra—occipital bone or spinet
but its place is occupied by the posterior extremity of the parietah} This is
a single synnnetricah lozenge-shaped bone, from the middle line of whose
upper surl'aee a longitudinal stout spine is developed, augmenting the surfaee
of attachment of the strong= tempor-al muscles. This spine is continued upon
the frontal bonel} as faras its anterior extremity. Both the parietal and
srontal bones are ossified, and were anchylosed together in the larger speci-
men: the limits of the cranial vertebrae are thus effaced above as they are by
the confluence os the occipital and sphenoids below. The anterior part of the
frontal is deeply notched on each side. There are no distinct ossified anterior
frontals7 but the posterior frontalsql are enormously (leveloped, and extend
backwards over the frontal and parietal bones¹ as far as the occiput, forming

a second bony shield to the skull, analogous to the osscous plates in the
