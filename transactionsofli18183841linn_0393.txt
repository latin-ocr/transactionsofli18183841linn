THE animal about to be described belongs to a genus founded and referred
to the class Amplm'hia by Fitzingerfi for the reeeption of an allied species
discovered hy Dr. Natterer in the river Amazon, and of which a brief account
has been given by that excellent naturalist in the Annals of the Musenin of
Vienna-l under the nain(¹ of Lepidosiren paradoxa„ a new genus of the family
of Fish-like or Perennibranchiam Reptiles, with the following characters:

‘⁴ Corpus anguillaeforine totuin squamatum. Pedes quatuor, valde distantes,
a(l;ictyli.''

In these and most of the other cliaraeteristics detailed in the text of
Dr. Natterer the present. speeies closely agrees with the Lepidos-iren paracloa·a;
the prineipal differences occur in the. relative proportions of the head, trunk
and rudimental filainentary extreinities.

The whole length of the Lepidos-iren pat-adora includes eleven lengths ot'
the head, nieasuretl froin the end of the mouth to the gill-openings: in the
present speeies the total length of the animal includes little inore than six
lengths of the head In the L. paradox-a the length of the body anterior
to the coniniencenient, of the ‹lorsal fin includes four and a half lengths
of the head: in the L. annectens there are only two lengths of the head be-
fore the dol-sal fin COllllllenceS. The length of the διῄει-101· extremity is one-
twelfth that of the entire body in the L. paradoma: it is only one-sixth os
the sanie length in L. annectens. This speeies is therefore distinguished
froin the Lepitlosiren paradoxa by the shorter relative length of the trunk as
