This forins a highly interesting addition to the genus, being nearly related to
J. triglecmis, froin which, however, it differs in several important ραι-11001015.
The leaves arc reeurved, and nearly as long ns the stems3 the bractes forming
the involucrum are five in number, longer than the flowers, and pointed. The
capitula have from six to ten flowers, and the sepals are narrower and sonic-
what acute ; the anthers are also acute, and they are double the length of the
dilated filainents. The stigmata are thriee shorter than the style, and the
ovarium is ronnded-ovatc, and it may be supposed that the mature fruit will
prove to be considerably shorter than the sepals. Moreover the rhizoma is
ereeping, and the sheaths at the base of the steins are much longer, dark
{Ji—own and shining. These characters sufficiently distingnish it from 111311(-
mis, in which the capitula are mostly 3-flowered, more rarely 2- or 4-flowe1ed,
the sepals and braetes obtuse, and the flowers longer than these last. The
anthei-s are obtuse, and four times shorter than the narrow simple filainents3
stigmata as long as the style3 ovariun] longer than the sepals3 and lastly, the
leaves are only half as long as the smus, with the cauline ones extremely
short. The root is besides not creeping.

This new speeies was discovered by Dr. Royle 011 Shalma, a mountain of
the Himalaya range, having an elevationi of 10,000 feet above the level of the
sea.
