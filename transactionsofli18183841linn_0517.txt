entomologists„

EUOPLIA *ἢ

Corpus subdepressum. Antemm’ lamiaeformes fere ut in Omacantlea'. Timr-«m
utrinque spinosus, dorso punctulatus. Elytra depressa, apicibus 2-spi-
nosis, spina suturali minore, lateralibus majoribus. In reliquis cum Lamia*
convenit.

The above genus Ι propose to separate from Lamia, as it appears to afford
ample characters to distinguish it. The antennae in Omacantlza differ in the
different sexes, the terminal joint of the males being considerably larger than
all the rest. In true Lamia the last joint is nearly equal in length in both
sexes: Euoplia therefore is more allied to Lamia Omaccmtlza, which one might
expect, from a similarity in the general appearance of the insects3 the former
may be considered as the representative of Lamia in Africa.

Cinerea; antennis corpore longioribus, elytris depressis ⁴2-spinosis variisque

This species inhabits Assam; it is unique in the collection of Mr. R. Hi
Solly.

To the same genus belong the following undescribed species in my cabinet,
namely, E. octospilota, sulphurea, Bengalensz's, Sinensis, and confusa, all of
them occurring in the East Indies. Iam doubtful if this genus occurs in
Africa: although it has been recognised in Africa, the entomology of the latter
country seems to combine the character, and possess some of the leading eha-
racteristics, of both continents, and yet is remarkable for its peculiar types of
form; one peculiar instance of which is the anomalous genus Heroden.
